[{"chapter_number": 1, "text": "Arjuna Vishada Yoga \u2013 Yoga of despondency of Arjuna\n\nArjuna the great warrior is overpowered by grief and delusion born out of a sense of attachment to his kith and kin. In his delusory state, he makes several fallacious arguments to support his decision not to fight. This sets the stage for the Lord\u2019s teaching which comprises the rest of the Gita.Below are the main themes of Chapter 1:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 20\nDescription of the armies and the preparations for the battle.\n\nVerses 21 \u2013 25\nArjuna\u2019s chariot driven to the middle of the battlefield amidst the two armies.\n\nVerses 26 \u2013 28\nArjuna\u2019s change of mind, leading to attachment (r\u0101ga)\n\nVerses 25 \u2013 34\nArjuna\u2019s grief on seeing the enormity of the task he is about to undertake (\u015boka)\n\nVerses 35 \u2013 47\nArjuna\u2019s delusion which stems from his ignorance about the true nature of oneself (moha)\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nThe epic battle of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, fought between the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Kauravas is the scenario in which the G\u012bt\u0101-teaching is imparted. Arjuna, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava, discovers the problem of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra in the battlefield. He surrenders to Lord Krishna seeking a solution. Then follows the great teaching.\n\nIn order to attain the wisdom that permeates the G\u012bt\u0101 one should go through the following phases in life:\n\n1. One should discover the problem of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, for which G\u012bt\u0101 happens to be a solution. Unless one discovers the disease, one will not seek medicine.\n2. One should become possessed by a sincere longing (t\u012bvramumuk\u1e63\u0101) for freedom from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. This alone can lead to committed and fruitful pursuit.\n3. One should realize that one cannot solve this problem independently. The maximum that one can do, as a limited human being, is a rearrangement or a reshaping of the problem.\n4. One should surrender to a Guru seeking his guidance. When surrender to the Guru happens, the ground is prepared for the G\u012bt\u0101-teaching to take place.\n\nThe entire first chapter and the first part of the second chapter are devoted to show these developments.\n\n\n<h5>The problem of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</h5>\nAs shown in the first chapter, the problem of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra can be said to be the problem of attachment (k\u1e5bp\u0101 or r\u0101ga), grief (\u015boka or vi\u1e63\u0101da) and delusion (moha). When one is not happy with oneself, one has to seek external aids. This leads to dependence and attachment. Since the conditions of the depended factors are unpredictable, the very peace of mind of that person is in trouble. A disturbed mind can make only faulty judgments complicating matters further. Thus a vicious cycle is created. This, in short, is the problem of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra.\n\n\n<h5>Verse details </h5>\nComing to the text, we find, in the first twenty verses, a vivid description of the armies arrayed for battle. After a brief instruction of Duryodhana to his commanders, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Lord Krishna, Arjuna, and others blow their conches, signaling the commencement of the battle (1 to 20).\n\nAt this fateful moment, Arjuna commands Lord Krishna, his charioteer, to place the chariot in the middle of the army to scrutinize the enemy forces. The mischievous Lord brings the chariot in front of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a and asks Arjuna to survey the army (21 to 25).\n\n(Till now Arjuna was convinced that his cousins are unrighteous and he, as a k\u1e63atriya, has to fight the battle to establish righteousness.)\n\nIn a moment of weakness, Arjuna slips from reason to relation. Instead of seeing the violators of dharma, he sees his beloved kith and kin. Naturally, Arjuna is overpowered by attachment. Then follow the twin offshoots of attachment viz. grief and delusion (26 to 30).\n\nIn the next five verses, we see Arjuna expressing his intense grief which shakes him completely. This indicates the extent of his attachment.\n\nVeiled by attachment, his discriminating power becomes inoperative and he commits a series of false judgments. Interestingly enough, Arjuna even quotes the scriptures to support his unreasonable stand. Thus, Arjuna gets caught up in delusion which is depicted from the 36th verse up to the end of the chapter (36 to 47).\n\nIn this way, Arjuna finds himself in the deep sea of attachment, sorrow and delusion (r\u0101ga, \u015boka, moha). Arjuna sincerely wants to get out of this problem. He thinks that solution is to drop the battle. But, one corner of his mind is not convinced by this. At the same time, he has not realized that the problem is too deep for him to solve independently. Hence he doesn\u2019t surrender to Krishna either. Thus caught up in a dilemma, Arjuna sits back on the chariot sorrowfully.\n\nGita 1st Chapter \u2013 Main Points\n\nDescription of the armies and the preparations: 1 to 20\nArjuna\u2019s chariot driven to the middle of the armies: 21 to 25\nArjuna\u2019s change of mind leading to attachment (r\u0101ga): 26 to 28\nArjuna\u2019s grief (\u015boka): 25 to 34\nArjuna\u2019s delusion (moha): 35 to 47\n\nSince Arjuna\u2019s grief is the main topic, this chapter is aptly called Arjunavi\u1e63\u0101dayoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 2, "text": "Sankhya Yoga \u2013 The Yoga of Knowledge\n\nArjuna acknowledges in the opening few verses that he is confused about his duty and surrenders to the Lord to instruct him about what is good for him. Thereafter, the Lord begins His teaching and by the end of the chapter, we get an exhaustive summary of the entire philosophical content of the Gita. Below are the main themes of Chapter 2:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 10\nArjuna\u015bara\u1e47\u0101gati \u2013 Arjuna realizes the depth of his problem and knows he cannot solve it by himself. These verses describe Arjuna\u2019s attitude of surrender towards his Guru, Lord Krishna.\n\nVerses 11 \u2013 38\nS\u0101\u1e45khya-Yoga \u2013 Lord Krishna expounds the highest knowledge about the nature of the immortal Self and the impermanence of all other things, including the body and the world.\n\nVerses 39 \u2013 53\nKarma-Yoga \u2013 Lord Krishna stresses the importance of doing one\u2019s duty and the way to perform such duty, the way to be a true Karma Yogi through discrimination, dispassion, equanimity and skill in action. Then he glorifies Karma Yoga as a way to come to Sankhya Yoga.\n\nVerses 54 \u2013 72\nSthitapraj\u00f1atva-up\u0101ya and Sthitapraj\u00f1a-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a \u2013 The Lord describes the characteristics of the one who is firmly established in the Self (Sthitapraj\u00f1a) and highlights the Sadhanas or practices required to attain such a state, where one lives as a Jivan Mukta.\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the first chapter, Arjuna was shown to be completely immersed in grief (\u015boka) caused by attachment (r\u0101ga) and delusion (moha). Independently analyzing the problem, he comes to the conclusion that withdrawing from the war is the only solution.\n\nIn the beginning of the second chapter we see the turning point in Arjuna. Chastised by Krishna\n\n(2, 3), Arjuna analyses the situation further. This leads to the two important discoveries:\n\n1. His weakness of attachment is a fundamental problem which cannot be solved by superficial methods (9).\n2. He has to surrender completely to a guru to get out of this fundamental problem (8).\n\nThus, Arjuna becomes a \u015bi\u1e63ya by surrendering to Lord Krishna. Naturally, Krishna also becomes a guru. Now that the guru-\u015bi\u1e63ya relationship has been struck, the teaching can begin (10).\n\n[Once a human being discovers a seeker in him, the guru will be right in front. The vedaantic teaching can take place only between a guru and \u015bi\u1e63ya.]\n\nKrishna straightway attacks Arjuna\u2019s idea that war is going to harm Bh\u012b\u1e63ma or himself. He points out that all the problems of Arjuna are because of delusion caused by ignorance, for wise men never have a problem (11). Thereafter, Krishna gives different reasons to establish that Arjuna has to fight this war:\n\n1. From the stand point of true nature of \u0100tm\u0101 (\u0101dhy\u0101tmika-d\u1e5b\u015b\u1e6di), Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and others are immortal. \u0100tm\u0101 is never subject to changes in spite of the changes of the body. It is neither a doer nor an enjoyer. Hence, neither is Arjuna a slayer nor is Bh\u012b\u1e63ma slain. So, why should he resist to fight? (12 to 25). Even if the \u0100tm\u0101 is impermanent, Arjuna should not lament. Whatever appears will have to disappear and whatever disappears will appear. Hence, one should learn to accept the change. [In fact, change is the beauty of the creation. It looks ugly when our outlook is partial or selfish.] Hence, why should Arjuna grieve for the physical separation from Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and others which is inevitable in life? (26 to 30).\n\n2. From the stand point of K\u1e63atriya\u2019s duty (dh\u0101rmika-d\u1e5b\u015b\u1e6di), Arjuna can fight if it is necessary to establish order. A k\u1e63atriya must look at the problem not from personal stand point, but from social stand point (31). Hence, why should Arjuna hesitate to fight for a righteous cause? A righteous war is a door to heaven for a k\u1e63atriya (32). If Arjuna avoids war, not only he be shirking his duty and losing heaven, but he will positively incur sin (33). For avoiding sin, at least, Arjuna should fight.\n\n3. Looking at the situation from worldly angle (laukika-d\u1e5b\u015b\u1e6di), Arjuna should not withdraw from the war. He will be called a coward by everyone (including the future generation) (34, 36). Shouldn\u2019t Arjuna fight to protect his reputation?\n\nWith these arguments, Lord persuades Arjuna to fight (37, 38) and concludes the first part of his teaching. He calls this s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga (39).  [In fact, the first argument which deals with the nature of the \u0100tm\u0101 and the body (\u0101tma-an\u0101tma-viveka) alone is the s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga.] Hereafter, the Lord enters into buddhi-yoga (karma-yoga). [Though s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is the true solution for sorrow, many are not fit to gain it because of the false idea (moha) that worldly pursuits can solve the problem. So, initially, one has to be allowed to pursue worldly ends. By this, one should discover for oneself that actions and their results cannot give permanent satisfaction. This is dispassion. A dispassionate mind can pursue s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga. Thus karma-yoga is introduced as a means to come to s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga.]\n\nFirst, the Lord describes the glory of karma-yoga (40 to 46). Then comes the principle of karma-yoga. One can choose one\u2019s action but never the result. The result is dependent on the laws of action. The other factors of the world, known and unknown, may bring a totally unexpected result. One cannot avoid that. Yet inaction will not be a solution (47). No one can completely know the laws of action. Hence, actions are often imperfect in spite of effort. So, one should ever be ready for any result. One can hope for the best, but should be prepared for the worst. When one acts with the above understanding, success and failure lose their capacity to shake him. One does not react, because he is not caught unawares. This equanimity in action is yoga (48). Thus, one can convert the binding karma into a valid teacher. This is skill in action (50). A tranquil mind will soon shed its false value attributed to the world and turns towards the \u0100tm\u0101 (52). When, through Self-knowledge, one gets established in the peaceful \u0100tm\u0101, he attains liberation (53).\n\nNow, Arjuna becomes curious to know the characteristics of a person who is firmly established in Self-knowledge (sthitapraj\u00f1a) (54). Krishna answers Arjuna\u2019s question and gives the means of stabilizing the knowledge.\n\nKnowledge cannot be fruitful unless it is stabilized and assimilated. For this, Krishna talks about two important s\u0101dhanas (58 to 68). They are the control of the mind and the sense organs and contemplation upon the teaching. By this, the knowledge sets (61). On the other hand, if these are not practiced, the mind and the sense organs will drag a person to the field of sense objects and gradually pull him down spiritually (62, 63).\n\nTalking about the characteristics of a wise man, the Lord points out that the man of Self-knowledge is always satisfied with himself and consequently, he is free from all desires (55). He is independent of the world to be happy. Naturally, he is free from attachment, hatred, desire, anger, fear, elation, depression etc. (56, 57). Though living in the same world, he enjoys a freedom and contentment which is unknown to others. Thus, if the ignorant man can be said to be in darkness with regards to the \u0100tm\u0101, the wise man is in broad daylight of the \u0100tm\u0101\n\n(69). The best comparison for the wise man\u2019s mind is the ocean. The ocean is independently full and is unaffected by the rivers, entering or not entering, dirty or clean. Similarly, the wise man\u2019s mind is independently full. It is undisturbed by the favourable and unfavourable experiences, entering or not entering (70). Krishna concludes this topic by glorifying this state as the Br\u0101hm\u012b-state, reaching which one does not get deluded again. He lives life as a j\u012bvan-mukta (liberated while living) even at the far end of this journey. After death, he becomes one with Brahman (nirv\u0101\u1e47am) which is called videha-mukti.\n\n\n\nArjuna\u015bara\u1e47\u0101gati: 1 to 10\nS\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga: 11 to 38\nKarma-yoga: 39 to 53\nSthitapraj\u00f1atva-up\u0101ya and sthitapraj\u00f1a-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a: 54 to 72\n\nSince s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is the main topic, this chapter is aptly called S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 3, "text": "Karma Yoga \u2013 Path of Selfless Service\n\nIn Chapter 3 of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord teaches the importance of action and explains why and how one must act in the world so that the mind and intellect are purified and relieved of their false attachments, thereby making them receptive to the Self-knowledge that was emphasized in the previous chapter. Below are the main themes of Chapter 3:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 7\nIntroduction\n\nVerses 8 \u2013 20 (First Line)\nKarmayoga\n\nVerses 20 (Second Line) \u2013 29\nThe role of a wise person\n\nVerses 30 \u2013 35\nSummary\n\nVerses 36 \u2013 43\nThe problem of desire and its solution\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the second chapter, the Lord praised Self-knowledge right from the beginning (11, 21, 46) and criticized the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da of the Vedas (42 to 45). Thereafter, He asked Arjuna to take to karma (48). This creates a serious doubt in Arjuna and the third chapter begins with this doubt.\n\nArjuna asks\u2014\u201cOh Lord! You seem to confuse me by contradictory statements. Tell me one\u2014knowledge or karma\u2014which will lead me to Mok\u1e63a\u201d (1, 2).\n\nBhagav\u0101n answers that there are two lifestyles called karma-yoga-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 (social life) and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 (secluded life). One can choose anyone of them as a householder or as a monk (3).\n\n(But there is no choice between karma and knowledge. Whatever lifestyle one chooses, one has to follow relevant karma for purity and then pursue knowledge to discover the freedom that is one\u2019s true nature.\n\nOf these two lifestyles, Krishna gives preference to social life throughout the G\u012bt\u0101. In the Upani\u1e63ads we find the latter emphasized. Choice depends on the maturity of the seeker.)\n\nFrom the 4th to the 7th verse, Krishna condemns inaction and praises an alert and active life. Inaction should be avoided because:\n\n1. Neither purity nor knowledge can be achieved by that (4);\n2. Desires force one to act and inaction will be a suppression (5);\n3. A mind without occupation will be idle. It will brood over sense pleasures. Such a hypocritical mind will soon fall (6). (Also refer II-62, 63)\n\nFrom the 8th to the 20th verse (1st line), Bhagav\u0101n deals with one of the most beautiful and important topics of the G\u012bt\u0101 viz. karma-yoga.\n\nHaving created the world and the intelligent human beings, the Lord Himself advocated (in the Vedas) the way of life which is karma-yoga. By following this, material and spiritual progress can be attained (10 to 14).\n\nSince it is the teaching of the Lord, the Master of the universe (Sv\u0101m\u012b), human being has to take it as a command (niyatam) and obey it as a servant (bh\u1e5btya) of the Lord (8).\n\nWhen we follow the teachings of the Lord, it becomes a gesture of our appreciation for all the gifts and blessings that the Lord has bestowed upon us. Thus, our work becomes a worship or loving offering (yaj\u00f1a) to God. It purifies the mind also (9, 13).\n\nLastly, karma-yoga is necessary to maintain the harmony of the universe upon which we are dependent. The working of the universe being a cyclic process, with the human beings as its important link, one must be aware of one\u2019s responsibility (duty). Thus, karma-yoga is only the duty (k\u0101ryam) of a responsible citizen of the world. One who does not discharge it proves himself/herself to be an immature human being (14 to 16).\n\nThus, karma-yoga is to be pursued because:\n\n1. It contributes to material and spiritual progress (yoga).\n2. It is the commandment (niyatam) of the Master of the universe.\n3. It is our grateful offering (yaj\u00f1a) to the Lord, acknowledging His gifts.\n4. It is the only way of maintaining the harmony (dharma).\n(In this chapter, Bhagav\u0101n does not talk about k\u0101mya-karma \u2014 actions to fulfill the desires. This shows that true karma-yoga does not involve k\u0101mya-karma. Hence a seeker must gradually reduce k\u0101mya-karma, even to become a true karma-yog\u012b.)\n\nKarma-yoga ultimately leads one to liberation through the stages of purity (\u015buddhi), enquiry (vic\u0101ra) and knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101nam) (17, 18). Krishna concludes the topic by citing the example of Janaka who successfully pursued knowledge while remaining in karma-yoga-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 (social life) (20, 1st line).\n\nFrom the 20th (2nd line) to the 29th verse, the Lord talks about the role of a wise man in the society, taking Arjuna as one. Any person with a higher status or knowledge (\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha), can influence others positively or negatively. Hence, even though Arjuna might not benefit from this war, he has to fight as k\u1e63a\u1e6driya\u2019s duty and set an example to others. Else, he will be responsible for anarchy in his own time as well as in the future (22 to 25).\n\nThus, both the wise and the ignorant should act \u2014 the former for teaching others, and the latter, for purity. The only difference is that the former will be detached while the latter won\u2019t be (27 to 29).\n\nThe 30th verse summarizes karma-yoga, giving five conditions:\n\n1. Keep the spiritual goal.\n2. Offer all actions to the Lord.\n3. Don\u2019t be concerned about the result.\n4. Be free from possessiveness; and\n5. Be calm.\n\nOne who follows karma-yoga reaches the goal of life and the other is lost (31, 32).\n\nLikes and dislikes (r\u0101ga-dve\u1e63a) born of habits (v\u0101sanas) pull a person astray. Still, a person should not go by what he likes to do but what he has to do (duty), even if it involves difficulties (33 to 35).\n\nAs an answer to Arjuna\u2019s question (36), Krishna elaborately discusses the problem of k\u0101ma-krodha (r\u0101ga-dve\u1e63a). They are the real enemies of a seeker (37). Clouding the knowledge, they force a person to run after endless insatiable desires and take away all the chances of peace and progress (38, 39). The senses, the mind, and the intellect are the base of desires. They have to be taken care of (40, 41).\n\n(Durv\u0101san\u0101s should be replaced by \u015bubhav\u0101san\u0101s by practice. False values should be replaced by right ones through discrimination.)\n\nOnce k\u0101ma becomes weak, one can discover the \u0100tm\u0101, which is beyond the senses, the mind, and the intellect and thus destroy k\u0101ma for good (42, 43).\n\n\n\nSince karma-yoga is the main topic, this chapter is called Karma-yoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 4, "text": "J\u00f1\u0101na Karma Sany\u0101sa Yoga \u2013 Approaching the Ultimate Truth\n\nHaving emphasized the importance of action in the previous chapter, here the Lord begins a gradual transition to the superiority of pursuing knowledge. Virtues of the man of knowledge are pointed out and a variety of worldy sadhanas are described as being rooted in action. But the Lord ends the chapter by exhorting Arjuna to action since right actions, as described in this chapter, are essential for readying the mind for knowledge. Below are the main themes of Chapter 4:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 8\nG\u012bt\u0101-stuti and avat\u0101ra\n\nVerses 9 \u2013 15\nKnowledge of avat\u0101ra and its result\n\nVerses 16 \u2013 24\nThe wisdom of seeing inaction in action and vice versa (The characteristics of the wise)\n\nVerses 25 \u2013 34\nThe glory and the means of knowledge\n\nVerses 38 \u2013 42\nBenefit of knowledge 35 to 37\n\nVerses 38 \u2013 42\nQualifications and disqualifications\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nLord Krishna dealt with karmayoga and s\u0101\u1e45khyayoga in the third and second chapters respectively. These two yogas are not newly introduced by Krishna. It has been initiated by the Lord in the beginning of the creation itself through the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da of the Vedas. Thus, this is an ancient wisdom which has stood the test of time.\n\nKrishna begins the fourth chapter by referring to the above aspect so that Arjuna will have reverence for G\u012bt\u0101. The Lord points out that He initiated the lineage of Vivasv\u0101n (Lord Sun), Manu, Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, and others in the beginning of the creation (through the Vedas). It is the same ancient vedic wisdom which is being revived by Lord Krishna through Arjuna in the form of the G\u012bt\u0101 because it had declined by that time (2, 3).\n\nNow, Arjuna wonders how Krishna, who is his contemporary, can be the initiator of the ancient vedic wisdom (4). As an answer to this question, Krishna introduces the topic of avat\u0101ra (5 to 8). [We are born because of our own karma (vya\u1e63\u1e6di-karma) as well as the total karma of the world (sama\u1e63\u1e6di-karma). In the case of the Lord, His own karma is not there. Thus the karma of the world becomes the cause for the birth of the Lord.] The evil actions of the wicked and the noble worship of the saints necessitates the manifestation (avat\u0101ra) of the Lord to punish the former and bless the latter. Thus the Lord establishes dharma in the universe (7, 8). But, since this birth is only through m\u0101y\u0101, it is apparent. Hence it does not affect the true birthless nature of the Lord (6). Moreover, since m\u0101y\u0101 is under the control of the Lord, His omniscience, omnipotence, etc. are not veiled. He remembers all the past as well as His true nature. It is from this standpoint that Krishna says \u201cI initiated the vedic tradition.\u201d\n\nFrom the 9th to the 15th verse, the Lord talks about His true nature and its knowledge. Though the Lord seems to be active, He is free from all activities and their results (13, 14). He is akart\u0101 and abhokt\u0101. One who recognizes this nature of the Lord also becomes liberated i.e., becomes free from actions and their results (9). (This shows that the true nature of the Lord and j\u012bva is one and the same.) But, being interested in the pursuit of various types of means and ends, one does not turn to this liberating knowledge (12). Still, some people manage to become one with the Lord by freeing the mind from attachment, hatred and fear, by surrendering to the Lord, and by finally gaining Self-knowledge (10). Lord gives whatever the devotee seeks (11).\n\nFrom the 16th to the 25th verse, Krishna gives the knowledge of the nature of action and inaction and the characteristics of the person of such a knowledge. Having talked about the rareness of such a knowledge (16, 17), the Lord defines a wiseman as one who sees actionlessness (of the Self) amidst the activities (of the body) as well as (the potential) action in the seemingly inactive body (18).\n\n(The idea is that the wise man accepts activities at the level of body because no one can expect relaxation at the body level. The very process of life is the continuous function of the body. One should only discover inner relaxation even amidst the activities by recognizing the true \u2018I\u2019 as the actionless Self. Therefore, true and complete renunciation is possible only through knowledge.)\n\nIn fact, the wise man never sees anything other than Brahman, that being the truth of all (25). Whether his body is active (20) or not (21), he is not affected. He is self-sufficient, contented, independent, equanimous, and free from fancies, desires, expectations, attachments, and jealousy. His actions are meant for the worship of the Lord which uplifts the humanity (22, 23).\n\nFrom the 25th to the 34th verse, the Lord talks about the superiority of knowledge over all the other s\u0101dhanas and the way of getting that knowledge. Various s\u0101dhanas are compared to yaj\u00f1as. They are: Brahmaj\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1a, deva-yaj\u00f1a, vi\u1e63ayabhoga-yaj\u00f1a, dama-yaj\u00f1a, \u015bama-yaj\u00f1a, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma-yaj\u00f1a and \u0101h\u0101raniyama-yaj\u00f1a. All s\u0101dhanas lead one to liberation by preparing the mind. But, being the direct means to liberation, Brahmaj\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1a is superior to all (33). To get this knowledge one should approach a guru who is established in the Truth (Tattva-dar\u015bi) and who has the necessary language to communicate it (j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b). Such a teacher must be approached with humility, faith, and reverence and asked for this knowledge. Instructed by them through the scriptures, one gains knowledge; not otherwise (34).\n\nFrom the 35th to the 37th verse, Krishna talks about the benefit of this knowledge. Gaining the knowledge, one will not get into delusion once again. For, he sees everything in the Lord as well as in him (i.e., he recognizes his identity with the Lord) (35). By this boat of knowledge one crosses over the ocean of sin however vast it may be (36). Like a blazing fire, this knowledge reduces to ashes (renders inoperative) all the karmas (37). Hence, knowledge is the greatest purifier. (All other s\u0101dhanas can produce pu\u1e47ya which itself is a bondage. Moreover, no other s\u0101dhana can destroy ignorance which is the root cause of all sins.) That seeker who has purified the mind will soon attain knowledge by the teaching of a guru (38).\n\nIn the concluding verses (38 to 42), Bhagav\u0101n talks about the qualifications and disqualifications with regard to Self-knowledge. One who has faith in the guru and the \u015b\u0101stra, sense-control, and a sincere desire for knowledge will gain the knowledge (39). On the other hand, one who is ignorant, faithless, and doubting is doomed. He cannot enjoy anything in the here or in the hereafter (40). Therefore, \u201cArjuna! Eliminate all doubts regarding the validity of these spiritual pursuits, and resort to karmayoga\u201d, advises Lord Krishna (42).\n\nKarmas do not bind one who is ultimately established in the doubtless knowledge of the Self (41). This is freedom through knowledge in spite of action \u2014 j\u00f1\u0101nakarmasanny\u0101sa.\n\n\n\n1. G\u012bt\u0101-stuti and avat\u0101ra: 1 to 8\n2.

The emphasis here is on renunciation but the Lord makes it clear that this is a state of mind and explains the qualities of a true renunciate. Below are the main themes of Chapter 5:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 6\nThe two lifestyles s\u0101\u1e45khya and yoga\n\nVerses 7 \u2013 12\nKarmayoga and its phalam\n\nVerses 13 \u2013 21\nJ\u00f1\u0101nakarmasanny\u0101sa\n\nVerses 22 \u2013 23\nVair\u0101gyam (detachment)\n\nVerses 24 \u2013 26\nVidehamukti\n\nVerses 27 \u2013 29\nInstruction on meditation\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the fourth chapter, Lord Krishna talked about knowledge and renunciation. He referred to the wiseman as one whose karmas are burnt by the fire of knowledge (IV-19). He glorified the wiseman as one who is free from possessions, whose only activity is the maintenance of the body\n\n(IV-21), and who is happy with anything that comes due to pr\u0101rabdha-karma (IV-22). Evidently, these are the signs of a monk. At the same time, Krishna concludes the chapter by advising Arjuna to take to action (IV-42). Naturally, Arjuna is not able to reconcile Krishna\u2019s various statements.\n\n(In fact, secluded life and active life are only two lifestyles. The first is called \u0101\u015brama-sanny\u0101sa [s\u0101nkhya, in this chapter] and the latter is called karma-yoga [yoga, in this chapter]. In both the lifestyles, one is identified with the equipments. He is a kart\u0101, and hence a sa\u1e43s\u0101r\u012b. This shows that lifestyle itself cannot give liberation. When Self-knowledge is gained, one discovers that he is akart\u0101, abhokt\u0101 and hence asa\u1e43s\u0101r\u012b. Thus, the renunciation of body-identification is true sanny\u0101sa which is called j\u00f1\u0101nakarma-sanny\u0101sa. This sanny\u0101sa can coexist with active life because it is mental renunciation. But \u0101\u015brama-sanny\u0101sa cannot co-exist with active life because it is physical renunciation. Krishna is advising Arjuna to remain in the society and attain the goal of j\u00f1\u0101nakarma-sanny\u0101sa. But Arjuna mistakes the sanny\u0101sa as \u0101\u015brama-sanny\u0101sa and sees contradiction in Krishna\u2019s teaching.)\n\nSo the chapter begins with Arjuna\u2019s doubt as to how a person can remain in duty and be free from actions at the same time (1). Krishna introduces the two lifestyles once again (it was discussed in III-3) and says that either of the lifestyles can help a person in getting mok\u1e63a (through knowledge). What is necessary in both lifestyles is a relative freedom from r\u0101ga and dve\u1e63a which is an important condition for Self-knowledge. Of these two, Krishna recommends active life as ideal for a common man. As the Lord Himself points out, a secluded life is difficult to pursue without maturity (2 to 6).\n\nIn the next six verses, the Lord talks about karmayoga and the stages of progress. A karmayog\u012b dedicates all his physical and mental actions to the Lord without concern for the result. Because of this attitude, the results do not cause any reactions in his mind. Gradually, he develops self-control and ultimately discovers his true nature which is the same in all beings. (Of course, this is accomplished through the teaching of a guru alone.) This is called j\u00f1\u0101nakarma-sanny\u0101sa (7 to 12).\n\nIn the following verses (13 to 21), Krishna discussed the characteristics of a wiseman and his wisdom. Since he has discovered his identity with the pure Self, his nature is the same as that of the Self. In His presence all the organs function. Neither does He act nor does He instigate anyone. According to their nature, the organs act and reap results. He is beyond good and evil results.\n\nStill, because of ignorance, one is deluded (15). When Self-ignorance is destroyed by Self-knowledge, Brahman, which is the true nature, becomes evident (16).\n\nBeing spontaneously established in Brahman through the pursuit of \u015brava\u1e47am, mananam, and nididhy\u0101sanam, these wisemen revel only in Brahman. Thus, freed from all impurities, they attain videhamukti from where there is no return (17). They recognize the one homogeneous awareness-existence which is behind all beings as their substratum (18). Thus, having discovered the identity with the defectless, ever unaffected Brahman, they overcome mortality here itself (19). Though pr\u0101rabdha brings favorable and unfavorable situations, these spontaneous, delusion-free wisemen are neither elated nor depressed (20). Detached from the world and established in Brahman, they enjoy infinite \u0101nanda (21).\n\nIn the next two verses, the qualification of vair\u0101gyam is stressed. Unless a seeker gets detached from sensual pleasures, he cannot attain infinite \u0101nanda. A discriminative seeker who knows the impermanence of these contact-born pleasures will not indulge in them (22). And, one who can restrain the impulse of k\u0101ma (desire) and krodha (anger) alone is a man of self-control fit to enjoy life (23).\n\nNow (24 to 26) the Lord talks about videhamukti. J\u012bvanmukt\u0101s who revel in themselves, who are pure-minded, who love all beings, and who have doubtless knowledge of the \u0100tm\u0101 attain oneness with Brahman (videhamukti) at the fall of the body.\n\nHaving clarified Arjuna\u2019s doubt, Krishna gives a brief reference to meditation in the last three verses which will be discussed elaborately in the next chapter.\n\n(Though doubtless knowledge can be attained by \u015brava\u1e47am, and mananam, the habitual notion that \u201cI am the body\u201d does not allow the knowledge to manifest as joy. Hence one has to assimilate this teaching by dwelling upon it, which is called nididhy\u0101sanam).\n\nHaving removed all (thoughts of) sense objects, having withdrawn the sense organs, having regulated the breathing, and freed from desire, fear, and anger, one should meditate with a desire for mok\u1e63a. Such a yog\u012b (meditator) becomes liberated forever (27, 28).\n\nKnowing the Lord who is the receiver of all sacrifices, who is the supreme Lord of all worlds, and who is the friend of all beings the wiseman attains peace (29).\n\n\n\n1.

For such a seeker, a life of contemplation is suggested along with an assurance that the path of meditation inevitably leads to the ultimate goal of Realization whether it be in the current life or a future one. Below are the main themes of Chapter 6:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 9, 16, 17\nBahira\u1e45ga-s\u0101dhan\u0101\n\nVerses 10 \u2013 15\nAntara\u1e45ga-s\u0101dhan\u0101\n\nVerses 18 \u2013 32\nArjuna\u2019s change of mind, leading to attachment (r\u0101ga)\n\nVerses 33 \u2013 36\nDhy\u0101na-pratibandha and parih\u0101ra\n\nVerses 37 \u2013 45\nYogabhra\u1e63\u1e6da\n\nVerses 46 \u2013 47\nYogistuti (Praise of the yog\u012b)\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nLord Krishna introduced the topic of meditation towards the end of the last chapter. Being an important topic, Krishna spends almost the whole of this chapter dealing with meditation. [Here, meditation is upon the Lord as the very Self (\u0100tm\u0101) of the meditator. This is meant to assimilate the Self-knowledge gained from the guru\u2019s teaching. The conditioning that \u201cI am the body\u201d will go only with the assimilation of the Self-knowledge. Assimilated Self-knowledge alone can express as \u0101nanda.]\n\nKrishna talks about five important topics on meditation. They are:\n1. Bahira\u1e45ga-s\u0101dhan\u0101 \u2014 Those disciplines to be followed throughout daily life which influence one\u2019s meditation.\n2. Antara\u1e45ga-s\u0101dhan\u0101 \u2014 Those disciplines to be followed immediately before meditation.\n3. Dhy\u0101na-svar\u016bpam \u2014 Nature of meditation.\n4. Dhy\u0101na-phalam \u2014 Result of meditation.\n5. Dhy\u0101na-pratibandha-parih\u0101rau \u2014 Obstacle and remedy.\n\nBahira\u1e45ga-s\u0101dhan\u0101\n\nAt the outset, the Lord indicates the role of karmayoga in meditation by praising the karmayog\u012b (1, 2). Karmayoga, being a conscious way of life, helps one in getting self-control. It converts an extrovert mind into a contemplative mind. Once this is achieved, one should try to lead a quieter life, because active life becomes an obstacle to meditation (3). Total detachment is the characteristic of a contemplative mind (4).\n\nIncidentally, Krishna highlights two important values viz. self-confidence and self-control. One who lacks these two finds himself to be an obstacle for any pursuit. On the other hand, one who enjoys the above two virtues finds himself to be supporting force in every field (5, 6). Soon he is established in the vision of the \u0100tm\u0101, the vision of equality (7 to 9).\n\nKrishna mentions a few other disciplines also, like moderation in eating, sleeping, working, and resting (16, 17).\n\nAntara\u1e45ga-s\u0101dhan\u0101\n\nThe meditator has to choose a secluded, undisturbed place for meditation (10). In that spiritually and physically pure place, he has to fix the seat which is neither too high nor too low, neither too soft nor too hard (11). Holding the body, neck, and head erect, he has to fix the sight on the tip of his nose, as it were (i.e., the eyes are half-closed) (13). Next, the meditator should withdraw the mind and sense organs from all other activities. The breathing also should be maintained even (refer V-27). With a calm, withdrawn, undisturbed, tension-free, and one-pointed mind, the meditator should meditate upon the Lord, the \u0100tm\u0101 (12, 14).\n\nDhy\u0101na-svar\u016bpam and Phalam\n\nMeditation is nothing but abidance of the withdrawn mind in the \u0100tm\u0101 (18). Having given up all desires and having restrained the senses through the mind, one should gradually bring back the mind with the help of the discriminative intellect, step by step. Once the mind is made to abide in the \u0100tm\u0101, there should be no other thought (25). Though the mind may get distracted, one has to bring it back from the respective fields to one\u2019s own \u0100tm\u0101 (26).\n\n(All this presupposes a clear understanding of Ved\u0101nta. Everything, including thoughts, is an object of the \u0100tm\u0101, the Awareness. The \u0100tm\u0101 is not an object for me to be thought of, or to be experienced. It is the very \u201cI\u201d. Thus, to knock off all expectations and struggles and to abide as the \u0100tm\u0101 with the knowledge that \u201cI am the \u0100tm\u0101\u201d is true meditation.)\n\nThus, constantly abiding in the \u0100tm\u0101, the meditator comes to enjoy permanent peace which culminates in the attainment of liberation (videhamukti) (15). He enjoys an everabiding mind which is completely satisfied with the discovery of the \u0100tm\u0101 (20). Since his \u0101nanda is not sensual, it transcends all the limits. Having discovered this inner fullness, he never loses sight of his true nature (21, 27, 28). Neither does he consider any other gain to be superior, nor is he shaken by even the greatest loss (22). This infinite \u0101nanda will never be lost because this was never gained. It was veiled by the false notion that \u201cI am sorrowful\u201d. Once this is removed, the inner \u0101nanda becomes evident. Thus, this is more a dissociation from sorrow rather than association (23). (This alone is known as j\u012bvanmukti.) Seeing the \u0100tm\u0101 in all beings, and all beings in the \u0100tm\u0101, he gets estabilshed in the vision of equality (29). This vision of the \u0100tm\u0101 alone is the vision of the Lord, because the \u0100tm\u0101 is not different from the Lord. Thus the meditator is ever established in the Lord inspite of his activities (30, 31). Being established in the \u0100tm\u0101, he looks at all bodies including his body with the same attitude of detachment. Hence he is free from selfishness and is spontaneously established in dharma. He is a saint (32).\n\nDhy\u0101na-pratibandha-parih\u0101rau\n\nNow, Arjuna puts a question regarding an obstacle to meditation. It is the problem of mental restlessness or extrovertedness. Because of this, one finds it difficult to meditate and assimilate the Self-knowledge. This frustrates Arjuna\u2019s mind and he asks for a solution (33, 34).\n\nKrishna gives two methods to solve this problem. They are detachment and practice. When the mind is extrovert because of desires, one has to remove it by seeing the futility of desires and their fulfillment. This is detachment. Even a detached mind can be restless because of past habits. This has to be gradually removed by consistent practice alone. Thus, mental discipline requires determination and patience (35, 36).\n\nStill, Arjuna feels diffident and he, somehow, thinks that liberation is not possible in one life. He desperately asks Krishna\u2014\u201cWhat happens to that seeker who has fallen from meditation? Does he not perish like a scattered cloud?\u201d (Arjuna feels that the meditator has no pu\u1e47ya, because he has not done any karma. He has failed to achieve liberation also. Thus being deceived of pu\u1e47ya and mok\u1e63a, he must face an unfortunate future, according to Arjuna.) Not being able to accept this, Arjuna surrenders to Krishna seeking clarification (37 to 39).\n\nKrishna consoles Arjuna by asserting that a spiritual seeker can never have a bad lot (40). The very meditation is a pu\u1e47yakarma capable of giving heaven and later an ideal birth for the continuation of the spiritual pursuit. The yogabhra\u1e63\u1e6da (one who has fallen from the path of spirituality) is reborn in a cultured, prosperous family, or may be, even in the family of a saint (41, 42).\n\nHaving got such a birth, he gets associated with the previous wisdom at a very early age (43). Irresistibly drawn by the past habits (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ras), he find his spiritual urge suddenly growing from a small flame to a huge conflagration (44). Committing his entire life to the spiritual pursuit and supported by the sa\u1e43sk\u0101ras of all the previous lives, he effortlessly fulfils his mission in life (45).\n\nKrishna concludes this chapter by praising the meditator in general (46) and praising the meditator of Krishna\u2013param\u0101tm\u0101 (Brahm\u0101tman) in particular.\n\n\n\n1.

Here the Lord describes His so-called lower and higher natures and describes the different types of devotees. Those who are attracted to limited, worldly results which are part of His lower nature are granted those desires by His grace but the few who aspire to His higher nature can achieve oneness with Him. Below are the main themes of Chapter 7:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 3\nIntroduction to the knowledge of God and the glory of that knowledge\n\nVerses 4 \u2013 12\nNature of God\n\nVerse 13\nCause of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\n\nVerses 14 \u2013 19\nBhakti, the remedy for sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\n\nVerses 20 \u2013 26\nSak\u0101ma-bhakti (devotion for material ends)\n\nVerses 27 \u2013 30\nNi\u1e63k\u0101ma-bhakti (devotion for spiritual end)\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the first six chapters of G\u012bt\u0101, Lord Krishna discussed the nature of the individual, karmayoga, etc. predominantly. In the following six chapters, the Lord will predominantly discuss the nature of God, worship of God with attributes (up\u0101san\u0101), etc. The individual effort was emphasized in the previous section. It will be the grace of the god that will be emphasized hereafter. In short, all these are necessary to achieve the goal of liberation.\n\nIn the first three verses, Krishna introduces the topic and its glory. Surrendering to God, whoever worships Him along with His attributes will ultimately discover the attributeless God (1). The knowledge of God with attributes, as different from oneself is called j\u00f1\u0101nam, and the knowledge of God as identical with oneself is called vij\u00f1\u0101nam. This is the highest knowledge because, the intellectual quest of a person finds its fulfillment in this knowledge (2). The very fact that the number of people who attempt and succeed in gaining this knowledge is very small shows the subtlety and rarity of this knowledge (3).\n\nFrom the 4th to the 11th verse, Krishna talks about the nature of God. God has two aspects known as the highest nature (par\u0101-prak\u1e5bti) and the lower nature (apar\u0101-prak\u1e5bti). The lower nature has eight divisions \u2014 five subtle elements, cosmic ego, cosmic intellect, and the unmanifest (4). [This is called lower because it is changing, inert, finite and dependently existent.] The higher nature is the consciousness behind every body and that alone sustains the entire creation (5). [This is called higher because it is changeless, conscious, infinite and independently existent.] From this God alone comes the entire creation which consists of conscious and inert aspects (j\u012bva and jagat). He alone sustains the creation and resolves it (6). In fact there is no creation from Him and He alone is the very essence of everything (7 to 11). Being the material cause of everything, God is independent of everything and everything is dependent on Him (12).\n\nIn the 13th verse, the Lord traces the causes of all problems (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra). Being deluded by the creation which is the product of three gu\u1e47as (of apar\u0101-prak\u1e5bti) one fails to know the higher nature (par\u0101-prak\u1e5bti) of the Lord.\n\nThe divine m\u0101y\u0101 (power of delusion) consisting of three gu\u1e47as cannot be conquered by anyone by one\u2019s own effort. Hence the Lord gives the only solution possible \u2014 \u201conly those who surrender to me cross over this m\u0101y\u0101\u201d (14).\n\nIn the next two verses, Krishna divides the entire humanity into five groups. The lowliest of those are those non-believers who do not accept or pursue the Lord. Leading a life governed by their own desires and taking to devilish nature, such people are completely lost in m\u0101y\u0101. The others, though they are devotees, worship Lord with different attitudes due to different levels of maturity. Thus \u0101rta is one who worships the Lord when he is in distress. Arth\u0101rth\u012b is one who worships the Lord for material prosperity. Jij\u00f1\u0101su, who is discriminative enough to discern the limitation of everything else, seeks the Lord through knowledge. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012b is one who has reached the destination of his life\u2019s journey by discovering his identity with the Lord (15, 16).\n\nIn the next three verses, the Lord talks about the superiority of the wise-devotee. His devotion is permanent and undivided. He loves the Lord has himself because he does not have the dualistic notion. Naturally, the Lord also loves the devotee as Himself (17). Then the Lord promises the highest goal for the wise man of non-dualistic vision [because fullness is possible only in non-duality] (18). Such a vision is achieved by preparing oneself through many births and rare those blessed ones (19).\n\nIn the following four verses, the Lord talks about other devotees who worship the Lord but seek various ephemeral ends. They look upon the Lord as the bestower of health, wealth, power, etc., and they seek those ends through rituals and vows (20). Still the Lord, out of compassion, fulfills their prayers (21, 22). But the Lord warns that everything except God is finite (23).\n\nThen the Lord reveals His true nature [which is identical with the seeker\u2019s nature and which is to be gained in terms of knowledge]. He is ever evident, imperishable, unsurpassed (24) and unborn. Still people, deluded by m\u0101y\u0101, mistake the Lord as the person subject to birth, etc. (25). Being of the nature of one non-dual awareness, God alone knows everything belonging to the past, present and future. God never becomes the object of knowledge (26).\n\nConcluding this topic, Krishna mentions the stages of devotion. Because of the fundamental self-ignorance no one can avoid desires in the initial stages of life. Naturally he will be \u0101rta and arth\u0101rth\u012b (27). When he worships the Lord, his mind becomes purified and slowly desires become less. He becomes a jij\u00f1\u0101su (28). Now, his attention turns towards knowledge and he pursues it, surrendering to the Lord. Soon he becomes j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b knowing all about Brahman, karma, adhy\u0101tma, adhib\u016bta, adhidaiva and adhiyaj\u00f1a. [He knows both the par\u0101-prak\u1e5bti and apar\u0101-prak\u1e5bti of the Lord.] Being established in his knowledge, he does not lose sight of the Lord even at the time of death (29, 30).

It then details various spiritual practices undertaken by those who desire to merge with the Supreme. This chapter also describes the two paths followed by the \u201cjiva\u201d after it leaves the body \u2013 one being the path of eventual return (to this world) and the other being the path of no return (krama-mukti).\nBelow are the main themes of Chapter 8:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 4\nDefinition of the terms Brahman, adhy\u0101tma, karma, adhib\u016bta, adhidaiva and adhiyaj\u00f1a\n\nVerses 5 \u2013 14\nThe significance and the method of remembering the Lord at the time of death\n\nVerses 15 \u2013 22\nComparison between two types of goals \u2014 God and world\n\nVerses 23 \u2013 27\nThe bright and dark paths\n\nVerses 28\nGlory of up\u0101san\u0101\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nLord Krishna concluded the seventh chapter by gloriying j\u00f1\u0101ni-bhakta as one who knows Brahman, adhy\u0101tma, karma, adhib\u016bta and adhiyaj\u00f1a (i.e., the complete nature of God consisting of par\u0101 and apar\u0101-prak\u1e5bti). He remembers the God at the time of death also.\n\nWith the desire to understand the above new terms, Arjuna asks seven questions to Krishna. The eighth chapter begins with these questions \u2014 the first six dealing with the six terms beginning with Brahman and the last one dealing with the thought of a person at the time of death (1, 2).\n\nLord Krishna answers \u2014 Brahman is the imperishable Truth, Adhy\u0101tma (or \u0101tman) is the same Brahman behind the individual equipments. Karma refers to all actions which are the cause for the birth of all beings (3).\n\nAdhibh\u016bta is the entire perishable, inert universe. Adhidaiva is the Hira\u1e47yagarbha who blesses all the organs of of all beings. Adhiyaj\u00f1a is the Lord as the presiding deity of all the actions of the individual (4).\n\nFrom the 5th verse till the end of this chapter, Lord Krishna elaborately answers the last question i.e., how to remember the Lord even at the time of death.\n\nWhatever be the predominant thought pattern at the time of death, that determines the place of the rebirth as well as the type of rebirth (6). Hence, if a person yearns for the Lord at the time of death, his rebirth will be conducive for the pursuit of the Lord in which he will naturally be successful (5). [It is said that those who are sagu\u1e47a-up\u0101sakas will go to Brahmaloka. They will attain liberation by gaining knowledge from Brahm\u0101, the creator himself. This is called krama-mukti]. But the thought pattern at the time of the death is determined by the predominant thought pattern throughout one\u2019s life. Hence, Krishna asks to remember God all the time so that we will remember Him at the time of death also (7). Though it may appear difficult, one can succeed in this by constant effort and sincere practice (8).\n\nFrom the 9th to the 13th verse, Krishna describes elaborately the practice of up\u0101san\u0101 at the time of death. One should control the organs of perception as well as action. Then by the skill of yoga-practice, pr\u0101\u1e47a has to be withdrawn (through the su\u1e63umn\u0101-n\u0101\u1e0d\u012b) to the top of the head between the eyebrows. Then, he should withdraw the mind back to the heart, its source. With such a mind he should meditate on o\u1e45k\u0101ra or any chosen deity with all devotion. He attains God who is omniscient, eternal, the ruler, subtler than the subtlest, the sustainer of all, incomprehensible, effulgent, and beyond ignorance. All scriptures talk about Him alone. All dispassionate seekers reach Him alone. All disciplines are for attaining Him alone. He is the ultimate goal of up\u0101sakas.\n\nFor a person who is sincerely committed to the practice of mediation of God and whose devotion is undivided, God is easily attainable (14).\n\nThen the Lord compares two types of goals, i.e., God and the world. Nobody can put the end to the cycle of birth by reaching higher lokas (worlds) or by acquiring better bodies. Even Brahm\u0101, the creator, who has the longest duration of life (his day being two thousand caturyugas) cannot be free from finitude. Then what to talk of all other things and beings which appear during the day of Brahm\u0101 and disappear during his night? Hence all the lokas and achievements therein are finite. God is the only eternal and changeless principle who is beyond the unmanifest and manifest creation. He is imperishable and is the supreme goal of life. All beings exist in Him and everything is pervaded by Him. Attaining Him, one does not take rebirth in the mortal world (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) (15 to 22).\n\nThus the Lord established that attainment of God is the highest goal compared to all other achievements. Now Krishna discusses the two paths that lead to the two goals which are subject to non-return and return. An up\u0101saka attains krama-mukti by departing through the bright-path (\u015bukla-gati) which is presided over by the deities of fire, day, bright-fortnight and uttar\u0101ya\u1e47am. (He goes to Brahmaloka, gains Self-knowledge from Brahm\u0101 and becomes liberated.) Ritualists go by the dark-path (Krishna-gati) which is presided over by the deities of smoke, night, dark-fortnight and dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101yanam. They come back after enjoying in the heavens (23 to 26).\n\nSince the bright path takes one to God, one should choose that alone. To take to that path one should become an up\u0101saka. Hence Krishna advises Arjuna to be committed to up\u0101san\u0101 (27).\n\nConcluding the topic, Krishna glorifies the result of up\u0101san\u0101 as superior to all other results gained through all other pursuits. Because, none of them can take one to that goal which the Upasaka attains \u2014 the supreme, primal God.\n\n(Up\u0101san\u0101 can take a seeker to Guru and \u015b\u0101stra. Naturally up\u0101saka becomes j\u00f1\u0101ni-bhakta. He is liberated in this very life. He has no travel. This aspect (j\u012bvanmukti) was talked in the seventh chapter and will be continued from the ninth chapter.\n\nIf up\u0101san\u0101 does not take one to guru and \u015b\u0101stra, he continues to be self-ignorant. He is not liberated in this life. But he travels by the bright-path to Brahmaloka. Instructed by Brahm\u0101, the creator himself, he becomes j\u00f1\u0101ni-bhakta and is liberated. This is called krama-mukti, which is discussed in the eighth chapter.\n\nThus up\u0101san\u0101 is useful for j\u012bvanmukti as well as krama-mukti.)\n\n\n\n1.

Here the Lord continues the teaching as it was given in the 7th chapter and reiterates and expounds on those matters. He again points out that those who seek mere materialistic results can gain those by His grace but anyone who desires Him alone will merge with Him, regardless of their worldly conditionings based on gender, birth etc. Below are the main themes of Chapter 9:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 3\nIntroduction to the knowledge, its glory and necessary qualifica-tions\n\nVerses 4 \u2013 10\nNature of God\n\nVerses 11\nCause of bondage\n\nVerses 12 \u2013 19\nAtheists, theists and types of up\u0101san\u0101\n\nVerses 20 \u2013 29\nSak\u0101ma-bhaktas and ni\u1e63k\u0101ma-bhaktas\n\nVerses 30 \u2013 34\nGlory of bhakti\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the previous three chapters, Lord Krishna revealed God as the ma-terial cause of the universe. Since the effect cannot be different from the material cause, it clearly follows that the universe cannot be different from God. Thus the entire universe is the divine manifestation of God. Hence whatever glories we see in the creation belong to the Lord alone. Krishna reveals this idea in this chapter as the culmination of his teaching of Vir\u0101\u1e6d (Vi\u015bvar\u016bpam).\n\nIn the first three verses, Krishna introduces the topic of vibh\u016bti and yoga \u2014 vibh\u016bti is the manifestation of Lord and yoga is the power of manifestation. Even great sages cannot talk about the glories of the Lord, because they are finite beings born later. Hence it is the rarest knowledge that is given. One who gains this knowledge will be free from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (1 to 3).\n\nIn the next four verses, the Lord reveals His glory by pointing out that the entire subtle universe of thoughts as well as the gross universe are born of Him. The seven great sages, the four sages Sanaka etc., and the Manus are all born of the mind of the Lord. One who knows this attains self-knowledge ultimately (4 to 7).\n\nThe following four verses deal with the Vir\u0101\u1e6d-devotees and the benefits of such a devotion. The devotees accept everything as a gift of God, because God is the source of all. They think about God, speak about God, hear about God \u2014 in short they spend their lives revelling in God all the time (8, 9). (Still they are sagu\u1e47a-devotees only. They are ignorant of the highest nature of the Lord.) The Lord says that He takes the responsibility of enlightening them. Out of compassion for them, the Lord lights up the lamp of knowledge, remaining in their heart. (The idea is that the Lord will provide them with a guru and the necessary conditions for the knowledge of the highest nature of God.)

Krishna begins the enumeration with the very Self. The best, the closest and the most evident expression of the Lord is the very \u2018I\u2019, the consciousness (20). Krishna concludes the list by pointing out that He is the very existence in all beings, because He is the material cause (b\u012bjam) of all (39). In short, whatever there is which is glorious, rich or powerful \u2014 all of them are the expressions of only a ray of God\u2019s glory (41).

The bulk of the chapter comprises of Arjuna describing the various sights he beholds within the Lord\u2019s form. Whereas the previous chapter showcased the manifestations of the One Supreme Self in the many, this chapter completes the narrative by driving home the point that those many forms are, in fact, sustained in and part of that One Self, which alone is the reality. Below are the main themes of Chapter 11:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 4\nArjuna desires to see the universal form\n\nVerses 5 \u2013 8\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grants the divine eye\n\nVerses 9 \u2013 14\nSa\u00f1jaya\u2019s description of the universal form\n\nVerses 15 \u2013 22\nArjuna\u2019s description of the universal form(first phase expressing wonder)\n\nVerses 23 \u2013 30\nArjuna\u2019s description of the universal form (second phase expressing fear)\n\nVerses 31 \u2013 34\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a answers Arjuna\u2019s question\n\nVerses 35 \u2013 45\nArjuna\u2019s description of the universal form(third phase expressing devotion)\n\nVerses 46 \u2013 55\nWithdrawal of the universal form and glorification of devotion\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the previous four chapters, Krishna established that the entire universe is a manifestation of God and, therefore, any glory in the creation belongs to God alone. Now, in this chapter, Arjuna appreciates this teaching and sees the universe as the very Lord.\n\nIn the first two verses, Arjuna summarizes the entire teaching of Krishna \u2013 the nature of j\u012bva (predominantly discussed in the first six chapters) and the nature of God (predominantly discussed in the later four chapters). Though Arjuna has received the teaching, he is unable to appreciate the universal form due to some mental blocks. Hence, he prays to the Lord for the vision of the universal form of the Lord (3, 4).\n\nLord Krishna agrees to bless Arjuna with the vision of the universal form (5 to 7). Since this is not possible to have such a vision with the ordinary eyes, Krishna grants Arjuna the divine eye for this special purpose (8). (Universal form is not a special form of the Lord. It is the Lord as the universe. As such, it is available for all at all times. The Lord need not show it. Still we miss it because of our narrow outlook of the world. Once we refine our mind and look at the universe, we cannot miss the Lord. His stamp is there in all, from a blade of grass to the farthest star. Such a mind which is tuned to see the Lord is the divine eye behind the fleshy eyes. It is such an eye that Krishna granted to Arjuna.)\n\nFrom the 9th to the 14th verse, we get a description of the universal form from Sa\u00f1jaya. He picturises the Lord as a person with all divine ornaments shining with the brilliance of a thousand suns risen together. (We should remember that this is a description of the world only, divinised by the change of outlook. Every exalted object in the creation should be taken as an ornament of the Lord.)\n\nFrom the 15th verse, we get Arjuna\u2019s appreciation of the universal form. (Arjuna goes through the various phases as he sees the universal form. The first response is one of wonder only.) Arjuna sees all beings in the cosmic body of the Lord. The sun and the moon are like his eyes. He sees the hands, legs, etc., of the people as those of the Lord. Now, the Lord\u2019s body with thousands of hands, legs, etc., appears without beginning, middle or end (15 to 22).\n\nNow Arjuna\u2019s attention is turned towards the mouth of the Lord which represents Time (Death). With blazing fire and protruding teeth, the Lord\u2019s mouth evokes terror in all, including Arjuna. Arjuna sees the entire world being scorched by this fire (Time), while many are rushing towards the mouth of the Lord. Some are already inside the mouth and some are crushed between the teeth. All these cause great fear and confusion in Arjuna and he begins to doubt whether the Lord is a loving father or a terrible destroyer (23 to 31). (This shows that Arjuna is still not able to see the Lord as a whole. He is able to accept \u2018birth\u2019 as part of the universe, but not \u2018death\u2019. This partial outlook is the cause of fear and confusion. This is the second phase.)\n\nThen, the Lord clarifies that the fierce aspect also is Himself, manifesting as the Time-principle. When the time comes for people to die, the Lord finds the instruments to bring this about and Arjuna happens to be one of them in the hands of the Lord (32 to 34). Having understood the Lord to be \u2018the cosmic stage manager\u2019, Arjuna surrenders to His Will and sings His glory (34-45). (Now Arjuna appreciates the Lord as totality, the basis of creation-preservation-dissolution. In front of the Lord everything else is insignificant. This appreciation makes him a devotee, seeking forgiveness for all his past omissions and commissions. Thus, the third phases is true devotion to the Lord, born out of right understanding).\n\nArjuna is indeed happy to have this unique vision of the Lord. Still, one part of his mind is not able to accept the totality, especially the destructive aspect. So Arjuna requests the Lord to withdraw his form (46).\n\nIn the last nine verses (47 to 55), we see the Lord withdrawing His universal form (i.e., the Lord takes away the divine eye that Arjuna enjoyed till now. Arjuna comes down to look at the world in his own private way.) The Lord praises devotion as a means to this cosmic vision. This universal form could be seen by Arjuna because of his devotion. Through devotion one can purify the mind, see the universal form, know the true nature of the Lord, and become one with the Lord.\n\nHence, Krishna tells Arjuna \u2013 \u201cDo actions for My sake; be My devotee; keep Me as the ultimate goal; be detached (from the world); be free from hatred towards all. Such a person reaches Me.\u201d\n\n\n\nArjuna desires to see the universal form: 1 to 4\nKrishna grants the divine eye: 5 to 8\nSa\u00f1jaya\u2019s description of the universal form: 9 to 14\nArjuna\u2019s description of the universal form(first phase expressing wonder): 15 to 22\nArjuna\u2019s description of the universal form (second phase expressing fear): 23 to 30\nKrishna answers Arjuna\u2019s question: 31 to 34\nArjuna\u2019s description of the universal form(third phase expressing devotion): 35 to 45\nWithdrawal of the universal form and glorification of devotion: 46 to 55\n\nSince this chapter deals with the universal form of the Lord, it is called Vi\u015bvar\u016bpadar\u015bana yoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 12, "text": "Bhakti-yoga \u2013 The Yoga of Devotion\n\nThe shortest chapter of the Gita but in some ways one of the most important ones because it clearly explains the meaning of a term that is often misunderstood \u2013 Bhakti.

(In fact, we cannot compare them. Everyone has to go through both and one can reach the Lord through nirgu\u1e47abhakti alone, which the Lord himself points out in the 4th verse. Still the Lord praises sagu\u1e47abhakta because of the context.) (2)\n\nFrom the 3rd verse to the 12th verse, Krishna gives out the entire range of bhakti which leads to liberation. In the first 3 verses (3 to 5) Krishna talks about nirgu\u1e47abhakti which is j\u00f1\u0101nayoga and which is the direct means for liberation. But, the Lord points out that this would be difficult for unprepared people (5).\n\nFrom the 6th verse to the 8th verse, the Lord speaks about the next lower stage in the form of vir\u0101\u1e0d-up\u0101san\u0101. He promises that such up\u0101saka would be rescued from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra by the Lord. (This does not mean that a vir\u0101\u1e0d-up\u0101saka can get liberation, skipping j\u00f1\u0101nayoga. The idea is that he becomes fit for j\u00f1\u0101nayoga and attains liberation through knowledge.)\n\nIn the 9th verse, the Lord comes one more step down. If one is incapable of doing vir\u0101\u1e0d-up\u0101sana, let him practice meditation on any form of the Lord (i\u1e63\u1e6dadevat\u0101-up\u0101san\u0101). Thus, up\u0101san\u0101 (on vir\u0101\u1e0d or i\u1e63\u1e6dadevat\u0101) becomes the preparatory step for j\u00f1\u0101nayoga.\n\nIn the next verse (10th), the Lord comes down further. If a person is too extrovert to take up up\u0101san\u0101, he is asked here to perform his duty (nitya and naimittika) as an offering to the Lord (\u012a\u015bvar\u0101rpa\u1e47am) without expecting any reward.\n\nWhen a person is full of desires, he is impelled to do desire-born actions (k\u0101mya) expecting results. For such a person Krishna prescribes the last step. When he receives the result of k\u0101mya-karmas, let him take it as a pras\u0101da (graceful gift) of the Lord and avoid reaction. Krishna indicates this through the word \u2018sarvakarmaphalaty\u0101gam\u2019 (11).\n\nThe above two steps come under karmayoga. (A karmayog\u012b becomes fit for up\u0101san\u0101 after some time. Up\u0101san\u0101 makes him qualified for j\u00f1\u0101nayoga. J\u00f1\u0101na helps him discover his own true ever-free nature.)\n\nKrishna concludes this topic by praising the last step of karma-yoga (12).\n\nFrom the 13th verse up to the 19th verse, Krishna gives a clear picture of the characteristics of one who has gone through all these steps and discovered fulfillment. [As a karmayog\u012b and up\u0101saka he was a devotee of sagu\u1e47a-\u012b\u015bvara, seeing the Lord as distinct from him. This is only lower bhakti, because he does not know the true nature of the Lord still (Refer VII-17). His bhakti is sagu\u1e47abhakti or bhedabhakti or apar\u0101-bhakti. Once he pursues j\u00f1\u0101nayoga and discovers his identity with the Lord, his bhakti becomes nirgu\u1e47abhakti or abhedabhakti or par\u0101-bhakti, which is an end in itself.] In these verses Krishna describes the traits of a parabhakta who is a sthitapraj\u00f1a (Refer II-55 to 72). (This serves twofold purpose. Firstly, it is an inspiration for a seeker to pursue his s\u0101dhanam. Secondly, the natural traits of a parabhakta serve as values for a s\u0101dhaka to be deliberately practised.)\n\nThis portion can be broadly divided into two. One referring to those virtues which a parabhakta spontaneously enjoys, and the second, referring to those negative traits which he is totally free from.\n\nKrishna concludes the teaching by saying \u2014 \u201cThose who follow this teaching with faith, keeping Me as the goal, are very dear to Me.\u201d (20)\n\n\n\nArjuna\u2019s question and Krishna\u2019s answer: 1, 2\nThe five stages of bhakti (pras\u0101dabuddhi, \u012b\u015bvar\u0101rpa\u1e47abuddhi, i\u1e63\u1e6dadevat\u0101-up\u0101san\u0101, vir\u0101\u1e0d-up\u0101san\u0101 and ak\u1e63ara-up\u0101san\u0101 j\u00f1\u0101-nayoga): 3 to 12\nTraits of par\u0101bhakta (par\u0101baktalak\u1e63a\u1e47a): 13 to 19\nGlory of the teaching: 20\n\nSince this chapter talks about all stages of bhakti, this is called \u2018Bhakti yoga\u2019\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 13, "text": "Prak\u1e5bti-Puru\u1e63a-Viveka-Yoga \u2013 The Yoga of Distinguishing Matter from Spirit\n\nWhereas the first 6 chapters of the Gita were focused on the individual self (jiva) and the next 6 on the seemingly external Supreme Reality (Ishvara), the final 6 chapters beginning with this one show that they are actually one. The key to this oneness is the ability to disregard the transient and inert matter envelopments and understand the reality of the Self alone. To do that, one must know what constitutes matter and this chapter explains that using the concepts of \u201cfield\u201d and \u201cknower of the field\u201d. Below are the main themes of Chapter 13:\n\nVerses 1\nIntroduction\n\nVerses 2 \u2013 7\nK\u1e63etram and k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a\n\nVerses 8 \u2013 12\nJ\u00f1\u0101nam\n\nVerses 13 \u2013 19\nJ\u00f1eyam\n\nVerses 20 \u2013 24\nPuru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti\n\nVerses 25 \u2013 35\nS\u0101dhanam and phalam\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the first six chapters, Lord Krishna talked about the nature of j\u012bva (tvam-pada) and karmayoga predominantly. In the second six chapters, Bhagav\u0101n discussed the nature of \u012a\u015bvara (tat-pada) and up\u0101san\u0101 predominantly \u2014 especially vir\u0101\u1e0d-up\u0101san\u0101. When a seeker goes through these stages of understanding and s\u0101dhanam, he becomes ready for j\u00f1\u0101nayoga which is the recognition of the identity between the j\u012bva and \u012a\u015bvara (asi-pada). This is the topic which will be dealt with in the following six chapters.\n\nThe thirteenth chapter is presented in the form of six topics \u2014 k\u1e63etram, k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, j\u00f1\u0101nam, j\u00f1eyam, puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti.\n\nThough these are discussed separately, we should note that k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, j\u00f1eyam, and puru\u1e63a are the same essentially. Similarly, k\u1e63etram and prak\u1e5bti are essentially the same.\n\nK\u1e63etram\n\nThe entire objective universe is k\u1e63etram. From the beginningless prak\u1e5bti (avyaktam) everything experienced by us comes under this. It includes mahat (cosmic intellect), aha\u1e45k\u0101ra (cosmic ego), the subtle and gross elements, sense organs of action and perception, the mind and its modifications (6, 7). Still, Krishna specially mentions the body as k\u1e63etram (2) because we generally do not see the body as part of the universe.\n\nK\u1e63etraj\u00f1a\n\nThat conscious principle which illumines the k\u1e63etram is called k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a (2). Having defined k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, Krishna reveals that the k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a is none other than the Lord (i.e. Brahman) Himself who is the consciousness in all bodies (3). Thus, k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a is one all-pervading consciousness. (This k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a alone is called j\u012bva. So, the idea given here is the essential identity of j\u012bva and \u012a\u015bvara.)\n\nJ\u00f1\u0101nam\n\nFrom the 8th to the 12th verse, Krishna talks about some important val-ues which prepare the mind for Self-knowledge. They are: humility, simplicity, non-violence, forbearance, honesty, service to the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control, detachment from sense objects, absence of egoism, constant awareness of the misery in birth, death, etc., dispassion, non-identification with son, wife, house, etc., being always equanimous in desirable and undesirable situations, unswerving devotion to the Lord, seclusion, non-indulgence in people\u2019s company, constant self-enquiry, and not losing sight of the fruit of Self-knowledge.\n\nJ\u00f1eyam\n\nIn the next six verses (13th to 18th), Krishna talks about the Truth which is to be known. It is beginningless, beyond sat and asat (13), all-pervading, subtle, far (for the ignorant), and near (for the wise) (16). Though undivided, it appears divided and it is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of all (17). It is the light of consciousness which resides in the heart of all (18). Being subtle, it cannot be known in its pure form. Yet, it shines in the body (as Awareness-Existence) and in the world (as Existence). One has to recognize it as pure Awareness-Existence by distinguishing it from the body and the world (14, 15). (This method of teaching is called adhy\u0101ropa-apav\u0101da-prakriy\u0101 i.e. the method of superimposition and negation.)\n\nHaving talked about these four topics, Krishna glorifies this knowledge as the one which leads the seeker to Him (19).\n\nPuru\u1e63a and Prak\u1e5bti\n\nNow comes the last pair, puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti (20 to 24). Both are beginningless. Blessed by puru\u1e63a, prak\u1e5bti creates everything (20 and 27). (Though beginningless, puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti are of opposite nature. While puru\u1e63a is conscious, changeless and real, prak\u1e5bti is inert, changing, and unreal.) The body, the mind, and their activities belong to prak\u1e5bti, whereas puru\u1e63a is a mere illuminator of all these (21). When puru\u1e63a obtains in the body as k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, it seems to be a kart\u0101, bhokt\u0101, etc. But as param\u0101tm\u0101, the absolute, it is ever unaffected and is ever the same (23). Not knowing this, when puru\u1e63a (i.e. k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a) identifies with the body and its gu\u1e47as, then, all limitations and the consequent problems arise (22). One who has the discriminative knowledge of puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti attains immortality (24).\n\nIn the following verses (25th and 35th) Krishna sums up the teaching and presents its s\u0101dhanam and phalam. The wise man is one who always abides in the Self, which is the same everywhere (28 and 29), which is actionless (30), and which is unaffected (32) like the space or like the light (34). The Self is not only the illuminator of everything (34) but also the substratum of the whole universe (31). In fact, there is no universe other than the Self (35). One who has assimilated this wisdom is Brahman itself (31) and attains the supreme goal of liberation (35).\n\nTo gain this knowledge, one has to purify the mind through karma-yoga, gain knowledge through enquiry (s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga), and ultimately get established in the knowledge through dhy\u0101nayoga (25 and 26).\n\n\n\nIntroduction: 1\nK\u1e63etram and k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a: 2 to 7\nJ\u00f1\u0101nam: 8 to 12\nJ\u00f1eyam: 13 to 19\nPuru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti: 20 to 24\nS\u0101dhanam and phalam: 25 to 35\n\nSince the main topic is the discrimination between the k\u1e63etram and k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, this chapter is called K\u1e63etrak\u1e63etraj\u00f1a vibh\u0101ga yoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 14, "text": "Gu\u1e47a-Traya-Vibh\u0101ga-Yoga \u2013 The Yoga of the Threefold Modalities\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 4\nIntroduction\n\nVerses 5 \u2013 18\nAnalysis of gu\u1e47as\n\nVerses 19 \u2013 20\nKnowledge as the means to transcend the gu\u1e47as\n\nVerses 21 \u2013 27\nGu\u1e47at\u012bta-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am and s\u0101dhanam\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the 13th chapter, Lord Krishna said that it is the association with the gu\u1e47as of prak\u1e5bti that is responsible for rebirth i.e. sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (XIII-22). In this chapter, the Lord deals with this topic elaborately and shows how one can be free from these binding gu\u1e47as.\n\nIn the first two verses Krishna praises Self-knowledge to draw Arjuna\u2019s attention. It is the greatest knowledge which takes one to the greatest goal of liberation. By this knowledge, one attains the nature of God Himself and thus becomes free from birth and death.\n\nIn the next two verses, Krishna gives a brief account of creation. Blessed by the Lord (puru\u1e63a), prak\u1e5bti gives birth to this universe. Thus, they are the universal parents from whom all things and beings originate.\n\nFrom the 5th to the 18th verse, Bhagav\u0101n makes an elaborate analysis of the three gu\u1e47as \u2014 sattva, rajas and tamas. They are born of prak\u1e5bti and are responsible for the human bondage. The Lord analyses them from various angles which can be depicted in the form of a chart.\n\nEven though all the beings have the three gu\u1e47as, they differ because of the predominance of one gu\u1e47a over the other two. (It is also possible to change the proportions for which alone all the preparatory s\u0101dhan\u0101s are prescribed) (10).\n\nIn the 19th and 20th verses, Krishna teaches the means of transcending the gu\u1e47as. The Lord points out that the transcendence is in the form of knowledge alone. The Self (puru\u1e63a) happens to be already beyond the gu\u1e47as (gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bta). It is the body (prak\u1e5bti) which has gu\u1e47as, doership, etc. Because of identification with the body alone, the Self (puru\u1e63a) seems to have gu\u1e47as. Hence the only solution is to discriminate and own up the gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bta puru\u1e63a as oneself (19). Through this knowledge, one discovers oneself to be free from birth, death, etc. This is liberation (20).\n\nArjuna asks Krishna about the characteristics of a gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bta and the s\u0101dhan\u0101 to achieve this (21).\n\nFrom the 22nd to the 25th verse, Krishna answers the first question. Gu\u1e47at\u012bta is one who is detached from prak\u1e5bti. He does not have I-notion in his body or my-notion in the world. Hence, he looks at the variations of gu\u1e47as objectively without reacting to them (22). He remains unaffected by the opposite experiences of life like pleasure-pain, praise-censure, honour-dishonour, etc. They are the play of prak\u1e5bti (23, 24). Being full, he does not seek anything and therefore is free from selfish activities (25). (Since a gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bta is invariably a wise man, this description tallies with the sthitapraj\u00f1a portion of the 2nd chapter as well as the par\u0101bhakta portion of the 12th chapter).\n\nKrishna concludes by prescribing bhakti as the s\u0101dhan\u0101 to achieve this goal. (Thus, the Lord answers Arjuna\u2019s second question. By the grace of the Lord one gets a guru. Through the guru, one gets the knowledge which makes one gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bta). A bhakta becomes fit to attain Brahman\u2019s nature (gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012btatvam) which is immortality and absolute \u0101nanda (26, 27).\n\nTo gain this knowledge, one has to purify the mind through karma-yoga, gain knowledge through enquiry (s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga), and ultimately get established in the knowledge through dhy\u0101nayoga (25 and 26).\n\n\n\nIntroduction: 1 to 4\nAnalysis of gu\u1e47as: 5 to 18\nKnowledge as the means to transcend the gu\u1e47as: 19 to 20\nGu\u1e47at\u012bta-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am and s\u0101dhanam: 21 to 27\n\nSince the main topic here is the discrimination of the three gu\u1e47as and the Self (puru\u1e63a), this chapter is called Gu\u1e47atraya vibh\u0101ga yoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 15, "text": "Puru\u1e63ottama-Yoga \u2013 The Yoga of the Ultimate Person\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 3\nDescription of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\n\nVerses 3 \u2013 6\nMeans of liberation\n\nVerses 7 \u2013 11\nBrahman as j\u012bva\n\nVerses 12 \u2013 15\nBrahman as jagat\n\nVerses 16 \u2013 18\nBrahman as puru\u1e63ottama\n\nVerses 19 \u2013 20\nGlory of puru\u1e63ottama-j\u00f1\u0101nam\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the 13th and 14th chapters, the Lord dealt with the main theme of the G\u012bt\u0101 \u2014 the essential oneness of j\u012bva and \u012a\u015bvara. Being a subtle topic, Krishna discusses the same in this chapter also, in a different way.\n\nIn the first two and a half verses, Krishna gives a description of the vast and endless sa\u1e43s\u0101ra by comparing it with the mighty a\u015bvattha-tree. Like this tree, this sa\u1e43s\u0101ra is vast, many-branched, well-rooted and not easily destructible. To add to this is its mysterious nature. (The j\u012bva is caught in this sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, helplessly struggling to free itself.)\n\nIn the next two and half verses (upto the 5th), Bhagav\u0101n talks about the means to get out of this sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. The first step is to develop detachment from this sa\u1e43s\u0101ra by recognizing its binding nature. (As long as one has value for worldly pursuits, one\u2019s mind will not be available for seeking freedom.) Having withdrawn the mind from worldly desires, one should seek Brahman, the cause of everything (4). (Seeking Brahman is nothing but j\u00f1\u0101nayoga \u2014 vedantic enquiry under a guru.) Then, Krishna highlights the qualifications necessary for this knowledge. Freedom from (reaction towards) the pairs of opposites, pride, delusion, and attachment as well as a commitment to vedantic enquiry are emphasized here (5).\n\nIn the 6th verse, the Lord talks about the nature of Brahman. It is not illumined by anything (because it is the self-effulgent consciousness which illumines everything). Attaining this Brahman, the supreme abode of the Lord, one does not return to sa\u1e43s\u0101ra again.\n\n[In the following sections, Krishna reveals that Brahman alone expresses in the form of j\u012bva and jagat (universe). From this it becomes clear that reaching Brahman does not involve travel.]\n\nFrom the 7th to the 11th verse, Krishna shows that the j\u012bva, the consciousness in every being, is the Lord\u2019s (Brahman\u2019s) expression only (7). At the time of death, this j\u012bva alone takes the mind and sense organs from one body to another body. (8). It is this j\u012bva who experiences everything through the sense organs (9). Thus, the Lord alone is expressing in the form of the very life and its functions in every being (10). The pure minded ones recognize this whereas the deluded ones do not (11).\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th verse, Krishna shows how the jagat (the universe) also is an expression of the Lord (Brahman). The light in the sun, the moon, and the fire is the Lord only (12). In the form of the sunlight and moonlight, the Lord alone sustains all living beings (13). As the digestive fire, it is the Lord who digests the food (14). The Lord alone is behind all the mental faculties of knowledge, memory, etc. He is the author and the content of the Vedas as well as the knower of the Vedas (15).\n\n(Thus, Krishna reveals that Brahman alone is in the form of j\u012bva and jagat. Hence reaching Brahman is in the form of understanding only \u2014 understanding that Brahman is never away from either oneself or the universe.)\n\nIn the next three verses, Bhagav\u0101n reveals Brahman in its true nature. Brahman, in the form of the manifest universe, is called k\u1e63arapu-ru\u1e63a. As the unmanifest universe (m\u0101y\u0101), the same Brahman is called ak\u1e63arapuru\u1e63a (16). Both these puru\u1e63as are relative. Beyond these two puru\u1e63as is the uttamapuru\u1e63a, the absolute. Because of its superiority, it is called param\u0101tm\u0101 or puru\u1e63ottama. It is the imperishable (attributeless) Brahman because of which everything exists (17, 18).\n\nConcluding the teaching, Krishna glorifies this knowledge as the means of fulfillment. With an undeluded mind, the one who knows this most secret knowledge of puru\u1e63ottama, becomes the knower of all and a person of fulfillment (19, 20).\n\n\n\nDescription of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra: 1 to 3\nMeans of liberation: 3 to 6\nBrahman as j\u012bva: 7 to 11\nBrahman as jagat: 12 to 15\nBrahman as puru\u1e63ottama: 16 to 18\nGlory of puru\u1e63ottama-j\u00f1\u0101nam: 19, 20\n\nSince the main topic of this chapter is puru\u1e63ottama, this chapter is called Puru\u1e63ottama yoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 16, "text": "Daiv\u0101sura-Sampad-Vibh\u0101ga-Yoga \u2013 The Yoga of Differentiating Godly and Ungodly Assets\nWhat are the qualities one must cultivate in order to advance spiritually towards liberation and on the other hand, what are the qualities that will drag us down? Explaining those qualities, this chapter classifies beings into the divinely good (\u201cdeva\u201d) and diabolically fallen (\u201casura\u201d) and describes the behavior of the latter at length. This is so that we may introspect and understand where we stand and correct the course as necessary.

In the following two chapters, Krishna discusses the values to be followed by a seeker. Though values themselves do not give liberation, they are necessary to gain knowledge. They alone prepare the mind and make it fit for receiving the knowledge. In fact, Ved\u0101nta is a pram\u0101\u1e47a (means of knowledge) only for a prepared mind.\n\nIn this chapter, Krishna divides all mental traits into two groups: daiv\u012b-sampat and \u0101sur\u012b-sampat. All sattvic traits come under the former, while rajasic and tamasic traits come under the latter. Daiv\u012b-sampat is conducive to Self-knowledge; \u0101sur\u012b-sampat is an obstacle to spiritual pursuit (5). [Without exception, every one in this universe falls under one of these two groups. From this it is evident that all seekers of knowledge must necessarily lead a spiritual (sattvic) life avoiding materialistic (rajasic and tamasic) tendencies.]\n\nKrishna enumerates daiv\u012b-sampat (1 to 3) and \u0101sur\u012b-sampat (4 to 21) which is listed below:\n\nDaiv\u012b-sampat\n\nFearlessness (1)\nPurity (1, 3)\nScriptural Study (1)\nCharity (1)\nSense-control (1)\nWorship of God (1)\nAusterity (1)\nStraightforwardness (1)\nNon-violence, kindness to all and absence of ill-will (2, 3)\nTruthfulness (2)\nRenunciation (2)\nCalmness and patience (2, 3)\nAbsence of slander (2)\nAbsence of greed (2)\nGentleness (2)\nModesty (2, 3)\nSteadfastness and absence of restlessness (2, 3)\nStrength (3)\n\n\u0100sur\u012b-sampat\n\nVanity (4, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18)\nArrogance (4, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18)\nPretension (4, 10, 17)\nAnger (4, 12, 18)\nCruelty (4, 9)\nIgnorance (4, 15)\nImpurity (7)\nAbsence of religious discipline\nAbsence of truthfulness (7)\nAbsence of faith in God (8, 18)\nEndless desire for sense-pleasure (10, 11, 12, 16, 18)\nDelusion (10, 15, 16)\nFalse values (10, 16)\nWorry (11)\nAttachment (12)\nGreed (12, 13, 14)\nEgoism (18)\nSlander (18)\n\u0100sur\u012b-sampat leads a person astray causing (spiritual) destruction ultimately (19, 20). Krishna sums up the entire \u0101sur\u012b-sampat as the three basic materialistic traits of desire, anger and greed. They are the three-fold gateway to hell (21). When one avoids these three traits and adopts the divine virtues, daiv\u012b-sampat, one becomes qualified for Self-knowledge and attains liberation soon (22).\n\nThe Lord concludes the chapter by pointing out that \u015b\u0101stra is the pram\u0101\u1e47a in determining what is right and wrong. One should know what the scriptures say and act accordingly (23, 24).\n\n\n\nDaiv\u012b-sampat: 1 to 3\n\u0100sur\u012b-sampat: 4 to 21\nImportance of \u015b\u0101stra and conclusion: 22 to 24\n\nSince this chapter deals with daiva (spiritual) and \u0101sura (materialistic) traits, it is called Daiv\u0101sura sampad vibh\u0101ga-yoga.\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 17, "text": "Sraddh\u0101-Traya-Vibh\u0101ga-Yoga \u2013 The Yoga of Differentiating Threefold Faith\n\nIn this chapter, the Lord shows how the concept of \u201cguna\u201d that was detailed in the 14th chapter applies to faith, worship, food, sacrifices/rituals, austerities and charity. The Lord explains that these common activities can each be categorized as sattvic, rajasic or tamasic depending on the manner in which they are conducted. Our goal is to engage in only the sattvic varieties since that alone is conducive to spiritual development. Below are the main themes of Chapter 17:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 6\nArjuna\u2019s question and three types of \u015braddh\u0101\n\nVerses 7\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a introduces new topics\n\nVerses 8 \u2013 10\nThree types of food\n\nVerses 11 \u2013 13\nThree types of yaj\u00f1a\n\nVerses 14 \u2013 16\nThree types of tapas (based on instrument)\n\nVerses 17 \u2013 19\nThree types of tapas (based on gu\u1e47a)\n\nVerses 20 \u2013 22\nThree types of charity\n\nVerses 23 \u2013 28\nSignificance of \u201com tat sat\u201d and conclusion\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nIn the previous chapter, Bhagav\u0101n said that \u015b\u0101stra is the pram\u0101\u1e47a in determining what is right and wrong and that one should act according to what \u015b\u0101stra says. Based on this, Arjuna raises a question here \u2014 \u201cTo what category does a person belong if he worships with faith without scriptural knowledge \u2013 sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic?\u201d (1)\n\nKrishna answers that he may belong to any category according to his temperament. An ignorant person\u2019s faith will depend on his nature since he has no scriptural knowledge to guide. (By observing various types of worship done by others, he develops his faith according to his character. On the other hand, a person who goes by the scriptural teaching will invariably have sattvic faith) (2, 3).\n\nKrishna differentiates three types of faith based upon the object of worship (4). Even the nature of worship varies according to faith. People of tamasic faith take to severe practices involving torture of the body etc. (5, 6).\n\nHaving answered Arjuna\u2019s question, Krishna discusses a few more topics namely food, yaj\u00f1a, tapas and charity, differentiating them into three types based on the gu\u1e47as (7 to 22). (Refer to the chart below.) [A seeker has to choose the sattvic type i.e. daiv\u012b-sampat and avoid rajasic and tamasic types i.e. \u0101sur\u012b-sampat.]\n\nBhagav\u0101n concludes the teaching mentioning the significance of the mantra \u201cOm tat sat\u201d. This originated from Brahm\u0101\u2019s mouth in the beginning of creation, and has been traditionally chanted during scriptural activities like yaj\u00f1a, tapas and d\u0101na. The word \u2018sat\u2019 has many meanings like existence, goodness, good action, steadfastness and an action as an offering to the Lord (23 to 27). [In essence the utterance of this mantra will sanctify scriptural actions and make them sattvic.]\n\nIn the last verse, Krishna emphasizes the importance of \u015braddh\u0101 (faith). Without faith all scriptural activities become asat, i.e. fruitless (28).\n\n\n\nArjuna\u2019s question and three types of \u015braddh\u0101: 1 to 6\nKrishna introduces new topics: 7\nThree types of food: 8 to 10\nThree types of yaj\u00f1a: 11 to 13\nThree types of tapas (based on instrument): 14 to 16\nThree types of tapas (based on gu\u1e47a): 17 to 19\nThree types of charity: 20 to 22\nSignificance of \u201com tat sat\u201d and conclusion: 23 to 28\n\nSince \u015araddh\u0101 is highlighted both in the beginning and in the end, this chapter is called \u015araddh\u0101traya vibh\u0101ga yoga.\n\n\nKrishna divides tapas on the basis of the gu\u1e47\u0101s and also on the basis of the instrument as given below:\n\n\n\n"}, {"chapter_number": 18, "text": "Mok\u1e63a-Yoga \u2013 The Yoga of Liberation\n\nThe concluding chapter of the Gita is essentially a summary of the entire Song of the Lord. In response to Arjuna\u2019s opening question, the Lord differentiates mere abandonment from true renunciation and explains that renunciation of the false identification with matter and surrender to the Lord is guaranteed to lead us to Liberation. Below are the main themes of Chapter 18:\n\nVerses 1 \u2013 12\nSanny\u0101sa and ty\u0101ga\n\nVerses 13 \u2013 17\nJ\u00f1\u0101nayoga\n\nVerses 18 \u2013 40\nThree types of knowledge, action, doer, intellect, will and hap-piness\n\nVerses 41 \u2013 49\nKarmayoga (emphasizing svadharma)\n\nVerses 50 \u2013 55\nJ\u00f1\u0101nayoga (emphasizing meditation)\n\nVerses 56 \u2013 62\nKarmayoga (emphasizing devotion)\n\nVerses 63 \u2013 66\nFinal summary\n\nVerses 67 \u2013 73\nLord\u2019s concluding remarks\n\nVerses 74 \u2013 78\nSa\u00f1jaya\u2019s concluding remarks\n\n\n<h5>Background</h5>\nLord Krishna dealt with Self-knowledge in the XIII, XIV and XV chapters. In the XVI and XVII chapters were discussed the values without which the mind will not be fit to receive the knowledge of the Self. With this, the Lord has exhaustively dealt with all the aspects of vedantic teaching.\n\nIn such a situation, Arjuna puts his last question to Krishna seeking to clarify the difference between sanny\u0101sa and ty\u0101ga. Now begins the XVIII chapter answering Arjuna\u2019s question. Bhagav\u0101n takes this opportunity to sum up His entire teaching which has been spread over the last sixteen chapters.\n\nThe chapter begins with Arjuna\u2019s question \u2014 \u201cOh Lord! I desire to know the true nature of sanny\u0101sa and ty\u0101ga distinctly\u201d (1). Krishna replies by citing the views of some people (2, 3). The Lord gives his verdict from the 4th verse onwards. Bhagav\u0101n does not differentiate sanny\u0101sa and ty\u0101ga. (This indicates that they are not different according to the Lord.) Krishna emphasizes the importance of obligatory rites (nityakarma) like yaj\u00f1a, d\u0101na and tapas, and asserts that they should never be given up (5, 6) (We should note that this advice is given to people with impurity. \u015a\u0101stras allow a person with purity to renounce nityakarma also). In the next three verses, the Lord divides renunciation into three types \u2014 tamasic, rajasic and sattvic. (For details see the chart)\n\nIn the following verses, Bhagav\u0101n glorifies sattvic renunciation. (In fact, sattvic renunciation is nothing but karmayoga.) A karmayog\u012b renounces all the results of action. In due course he gets Self-knowledge. He is not affected by the consequences whether they are good, evil or a mixture of both (10 to 12).\n\nFrom the 13th to the 17th verse, Krishna gives a gist of j\u00f1\u0101nayoga. Five factors are involved in every action \u2014 the body, pr\u0101\u1e47a, the mind with sense organs, the ego and the presiding divinity of all these. (In short, they are the four ko\u015b\u0101s and the presiding divinity) (13, 14). All actions, good or evil, are accomplished through these five factors only (15). The Self is not involved in any action. But, due to identification with the above factors, one mistakes oneself to be a doer (16). On the other hand, the wiseman, who does not have the false \u2018I\u2019 (aha\u1e45k\u0101ra) born of identification, is free from all karmas in spite of the activities of his equipments. He is neither a doer, nor an enjoyer (17).\n\nTaking a diversion, Bhagav\u0101n introduces six factors necessary for any vyavah\u0101ra (transaction). They are \u2014 knower, knowledge, known, doer, action and the instrument of action (18). Of these six factors, Krishna takes up three (knowledge, action and doer) for further division based on the three gu\u1e47as (19). Later, the Lord divides the intellect and will also on the same basis (29). Finally, Krishna talks about three types of happiness (36). (For details see the chart)\n\n\n\nKrishna \n\nKrishna concludes this topic by pointing out that there is nothing in the creation which is free from these three gu\u1e47as (40).\n\nWith an intention to sum up the entire G\u012bt\u0101-teaching, Bhagav\u0101n gives the essence of karmayoga (41 to 49) and j\u00f1\u0101nayoga (50 to 55) in the following section.\n\nHaving thus concluded the teaching, the Lord states the qualifications necessary to receive this. One who has no faith, discipline, devotion and desire to know should not be given this knowledge (67).The duties of the four var\u1e47as (br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras) are prescribed in the scriptures based on their nature (41 to 44). Karmayoga is the performance of one\u2019s own duty as an offering to the Lord. This renders the mind fit for knowledge (45, 46). Here, Krishna makes it a point to emphasize the importance of svadharma (duty). It is necessary not only for the sake of purity but for the sake of social harmony also. Shriking one\u2019s duty can only lead to total confusion (47, 48). The purified seeker, who is detached and self-controlled, will soon attain liberation through j\u00f1\u0101nayoga (40).\n\nNow the Lord introduces j\u00f1\u0101nayoga and gives a brief outline of meditation i.e. nididhy\u0101sanam (which is necessary to assimilate the knowledge gained through \u015brava\u1e47am and mananam). Having restrained all organs and having given up all disturbing thoughts like desire, anger etc., one should remain in a secluded place (51 to 53). Being firmly established in his Brahmannature, he becomes free from grief and desire. Being the same to all beings, he enjoys the highest devotion to the Lord (54). Having known the Lord in His true nature, he becomes one with Him (55). (Becoming one is nothing but dropping the notion of division.)\n\nIn the following verses (56 to 63), Krishna comes back to karmayoga, emphasizing the aspect of devotion i.e. the attitude of surrender. Constantly remembering the Lord, if one dedicates all his actions to Him, that devotee attains the Lord ultimately by effortlessly crossing over all obstacles (56 to 58). On the other hand, if one tries to evade his duty, which is based on his nature, it will be in vain and harmful (58 to 60). Hence, surrendering to the Lord of the heart, the controller of all, a devotee should strive to attain supreme peace by His grace (61 to 62). With this, Bhagav\u0101n concludes the teaching and directs Arjuna to do whatever he likes (63). But, the affection towards Arjuna overpowers Krishna once again (64). Hence, the Lord repeats His teaching emphatically once again \u2014 \u201cFix the mind on Me. (Be) My devotee. (Be) My worshiper. Surrender to Me. You shall reach Me alone. Truly do I promise to you. You are dear to Me. Having renounced all actions, seek Me, the nondual, (as your) shelter. I shall liberate you from all sins. Do not grieve\u201d (65, 66). (These two verses are presenting karmayoga and j\u00f1\u0101nayoga in capsule form.)\n\nNow comes the phalam. One who imparts and the one who receives this wisdom attain the Lord Himself (68 to 70). Even the one who merely hears this with faith attains higher worlds (71).\n\nBeing satisfied with the teaching, Krishna asks Arjuna whether his delusion is gone. Arjuna gratefully acknowledges, promising to abide by the Lord\u2019s teaching (72, 73).\n\nNow Sa\u00f1jaya addresses Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, exclaiming how blessed he was to listen to this glorious dialogue between the Lord and Arjuna (74, 75). Sa\u00f1jaya remembers the whole dialogue and the cosmic vision with thrill (76, 77). He concludes his remarks with the declaration \u2014 \u201cWhere there is Krishna, the Lord of yoga, and where there is Arjuna, the wielder of the bow, there will be permanent wealth, victory, prosperity and justice\u201d (78).\n\n\n\nSanny\u0101sa and ty\u0101ga: 1 to 12\nJ\u00f1\u0101nayoga: 13 to 17\nThree types of knowledge, action, doer, intellect, will and happiness: 18 to 40\nKarmayoga (emphasizing svadharma): 41 to 49\nJ\u00f1\u0101nayoga (emphasizing meditation): 50 to 55\nKarmayoga (emphasizing devotion): 56 to 62\nFinal summary: 63 to 66\nLord\u2019s concluding remarks: 67 to 73\nSa\u00f1jaya\u2019s concluding remarks: 74 to 78\n\nSince the chapter begins with Sanny\u0101sa which is the means of liberation, it is called Mok\u1e63a Sanny\u0101sa yoga.\n\n"}]
