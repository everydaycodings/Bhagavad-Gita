        "commentary": "The two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well prepared to fight a war that was inevitable. Still, in this verse, King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu\u2019s sons were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight, then why did he ask such a question?The blind King Dhritarashtra\u2019s fondness for his own sons had clouded his spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue. He had usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas, sons of his brother Pandu. Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of this battle.The words dharma k\u1e63hetre, the land of dharma (virtuous conduct) used by Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing.\u00a0 Kurukshetra is described as kuruk\u1e63hetra\u1e41 deva yajanam in the Shatapath Brahman, the Vedic textbook detailing rituals. It means \u201cKurukshetra is the sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.\u201d\u00a0Hence, it was regarded as the sacred land that nourished dharma.\u00a0Dhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his sons. If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce. A peaceful settlement meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them.\u00a0He felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that this war transpires.\u00a0He was uncertain of the consequences of the war, yet desired to determine the fate of his sons. Therefore, he asked Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground."

        "commentary": "Sanjay understood Dhritarashtra\u2019s concern, who wanted an assurance that the battle would eventuate. Sanjay tried to allay his worry by informing that the Pandava army was standing in a military formation, ready for battle. Then he moved on to tell him what his son Duryodhana was doing on the battlefield.As King Dhritarashtra was blind, his eldest son Duryodhana virtually ruled the kingdom of Hastinapur. In the Mahabharata, he is described as very rude, egoistic, evil and cruel by nature. Since his childhood, he had a strong dislike for the Pandavas and left no opportunity to demean them. He was aware that to rule over the entire kingdom of Hastinapur unchallenged he needed to eliminate them. However, standing on the battlefield, when he saw the large Pandava army, he was baffled.\u00a0 He had underestimated the Pandavas, the extent of military might they had gathered was way beyond his expectation.Duryodhana approached his guru Dronacharya with the pretense of offering respect, but his actual purpose was to palliate his own nervousness. His move towards his guru also reveals that the mammoth military formation of the Pandava army unnerved him and he was now fearful of the outcome of this war.The next nine verses are spoken by Duryodhan."

        "commentary": "Duryodhana asked Dronacharya to look at the skillfully arranged military phalanx of the Pandava army led by their commander-in-chief Dhristadyumna, King Dhrupad\u2019s son. He was also one of Dronacharya\u2019s pupils. Duryodhana was subtly reminding his teacher of a mistake he had committed in the past.Many years back, Dronacharya along with the Pandavas had defeated King Drupad in a battle and took away half his kingdom. To avenge his defeat, Drupad performed a sacrifice to beget a son. Dhristadyumna was born out of that sacrificial fire, with a boon that he would kill Dronacharya in the future. Even though Dronacharya was aware, when he was approached for Dhristadyumna\u2019s military training, he very humbly accepted and imparted all his knowledge impartially to his pupil.Duryodhana was reminding Dronacharya that even though Dhristadyumna was his pupil, he was also Drupad\u2019s son, with a boon to kill him. He wanted to ensure that as in the past, Dhronacharya should not become lenient towards his pupils, now that, they were on the battlefield."

He had never expected his opponents would mobilize an army of warriors with such military prowess, who would be formidable in battle. Out of fear of the looming catastrophe, he started enumerating the names of all the mah\u0101rath\u012bs (warriors who were singly equivalent in strength to ten thousand ordinary warriors) gathered on the Pandava side. They were all exceptional heroes, and great military commanders, equivalent in valor to his cousins Arjun and Bheem."

An impudent Duryodhana even doubted the loyalty of his own preceptor. Cunning Duryodhana purposefully addressed his teacher as dwijottama (best amongst the twice-born, or Brahmins). His denigrating and vailed reminder for Dronacharya was that, if he did not display his valor in this battle, he would be considered a lowly Brahmin, who was only interested in the fine food and lavish lifestyle at the king\u2019s palace.Then to cover up his vicious words and boost his teacher\u2019s and his own morale; Duryodhana started naming all the great generals present on the Kaurava side, describing their valor and military expertise."

        "commentary": "The commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army was Grandsire Bheeshma. Apart from being an exceptional warrior, he had an extraordinary boon. He could choose the time of his death, this meant he was practically invincible. Duryodhana felt that under Bheeshma\u2019s command their army was undefeatable. Whereas, the Pandava army was secured by Duryodhana\u2019s sworn enemy, Bheema. Hence, he started comparing his Grandfather Bheeshma\u2019s strength with his cousin Bheema.Vinaash kale vipreet buddhi as the proverb goes, which means that when the end draws near, egoistic people indulge in vainglory instead of being humble in evaluating their situation. This tragic irony of fate is reflected here in Duryodhana\u2019s self-aggrandizing statement that; their army\u2019s strength secured by Bheeshma was unlimited.However, both Kauravas and Pandavas were Bheeshma\u2019s grandchildren and as the oldest living member of the Kuru family, he was concerned about their welfare. He was compassionate towards the Pandavas, but was bound by his ethical commitment towards the throne of Hastinapur and its subjects. Therefore, halfheartedly, he led the Kaurava army against them.Bheeshma was also aware that in this holy war, along with all the great warriors of the world the Supreme Lord Krishna Himself was present. Lord Krishna was with the Pandavas, which meant Dharma was on their side, and no power in the entire universe could make the side of Adharma win.He had vowed to protect the kingdom of Hastinapur and its subjects and to fulfill his responsibility towards them Bheeshma led the Kaurava army, even though he was aware of their wrongdoings. This decision of Bheeshma accentuates his strength of character and enigmatic personality."

It is a combination of two words, M\u0101 which refers to goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and dhav is used for husband. Goddess Lakshmi is Lord Vishnu\u2019s wife, who is one of the many forms of Shree Krishna. This verse implies that the goddess of prosperity was with the Pandavas, and by her grace, they would be triumphant in this war and reclaim their kingdom soon.The sons of King Pandu are called Pandavas and it may be used for any of the five brothers. In this verse, the Pandava being referred to is Arjun, the third among the five. He was a mighty warrior and a superior archer. His magnificent chariot was a gift from Agni, the celestial god of fire."

It so happened that, once Arjun became very boastful of his archery skills and quipped at Shree Krishna.

As this attachment is based on ignorance it carries with it the physical burdens of life like pain, sorrow, grief, and death. Only the death of the physical body can end these materialistic attachments. We are more than just the physical body; our eternal souls are beyond life and death.

His condition was the creation of his own material attachments and caused his dereliction of duty. This was a completely unexpected behavior from someone who was considered the epitome of devotion and self-surrender to God. In fact, before the battle, when both parties were mobilizing their armies; given a choice between the entire armed Yadu army and the unarmed Lord Shree Krishna; Arjun chose the Lord, as he had complete faith in him.At this point let us consider who Arjun really was. He was definitely not a novice, bereft of spiritual knowledge. His celestial father was Indra, the king of heaven. Arjun had been to his abode and received several boons from him and other celestial beings. In his past life, Arjun was Nar, part of the twin descensions the Nar-Narayan; where Nar was the perfected soul situated in transcendental knowledge and Narayan the Supreme Lord. Then why in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, a grand warrior of such stature was dropping his weapons? What was the cause of his misery?\u00a0For the benefit of future generations, Shree Krishna wanted to bring forth the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita. By intentionally confusing Arjun, the Lord had created this opportunity. In this chapter, Arjun put forth to the Lord several arguments and justifications why he should not fight this war, and in the subsequent chapters Shree Krishna has elaborated upon why Arjun\u2019s arguments were inappropriate, and the way forward."

        "commentary": "It could be argued that Arjun needed to fight and win the kingdom to maintain his livelihood. But, Arjun refutes that line of thought here. He says that he would prefer to live by begging than commit this heinous crime. He further believes that if he does indulge in this heinous act of fighting the war and kills his elders and relatives, his conscience will not allow him to enjoy any of the fruits of his action in this world, such as riches and power.Shakespeare\u2019s play Macbeth carries a telling example of a person not being able to enjoy even the natural state of sleep due to guilty conscience, let alone enjoy any wealth and power that comes along by immoral conduct. Macbeth was a nobleman of Scotland. Once while travelling, the king of Scotland came to rest the night at his house. Macbeth\u2019s wife incited him to murder the king and usurp his throne. Macbeth got swayed by her advice and assassinated the king, and thereafter, he and Lady Macbeth were crowned as the king and queen of Scotland. However, for years after that, Macbeth would be found walking in his palace, fully awake at night. The author writes, \u201cMacbeth hath killed sleep, and so Macbeth shall sleep no more.\u201d The queen would be found repeatedly washing her hands, as if to remove imaginary blood stains. In this verse, Arjun commiserates that, if he did kill these noble elders, tainted with their blood, his conscience would not let him enjoy all the royal benefits of ruling the kingdom."

        "commentary": "When evaluating the most suitable course of action, one considers various alternatives and their consequences. Arjun was debating whether it would be desirable to defeat the Kauravas or to be defeated by them. Both alternatives seemed like defeat, for if he did win the war by slaying the Kauravas, he would have no further desire to live.However, the fact was that Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. had acted ignobly by taking the side of the unrighteous Kauravas. The word arthak\u0101m has been used for them, implying, \u201cattached to wealth and position,\u201d they had taken the side of the wicked Duryodhan. So, killing them in the war was a natural consequence. In fact, after the war, Bheeshma himself admitted that a teacher who acts ignobly is fit to be abandoned.Here, special mention needs to be made of Bheeshma. According to the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam (verse 9.22.19), he was a great devotee of Shree Krishna. He was a master of his senses, and an icon of chivalry and generosity. He was a knower of the Absolute Truth, and had vowed to always speak the truth in his life. Even death could only come to him when he chose to accept it. For various reasons, he is enumerated amongst the twelve great personalities, or Mah\u0101jans, mentioned in the Bh\u0101gavatam:swayambh\u016br n\u0101rada\u1e25 \u015bhambhu\u1e25 kum\u0101ra\u1e25 kapilo manu\u1e25prahl\u0101do janako bh\u012b\u1e63hmo balir vaiy\u0101sakir vayam (6.3.20) [v1]\u201cThese are the twelve great knowers of religious principles\u2014the first-born Brahma, Sage Narad, Lord Shiv, the four Kumars, Bhagavan Kapil (son of Devahuti), Svayambhuva Manu, Prahlad Maharaj, Janak Maharaj, Grandfather Bheeshma, Bali Maharaj, Shukadev Muni, and Ved Vyas.\u201dHence, Bheeshma was an enlightened soul, whose actions could never be against the principles of dharma. However, his profound character was beyond mundane reasoning. Even though he fought on the side of the Kauravas, he said to Yudhishthir (the eldest of the Pandava brothers) before the war, \u201cI am obliged to combat on the side of unrighteousness, but I give you the boon that you will be victorious.\u201d Bheeshma knew that the righteous Pandavas, who had the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna on their side, could never lose. By taking the side of adharma (unrighteousness), he showed that even the biggest forces on heaven and earth could not make unholiness win in this holy war. He thus offered the biggest sacrifice of laying down his life, to assist the divine pastimes of Lord Krishna.Shree Krishna was well aware of Bheeshma\u2019s deep devotion toward him, despite his fighting from the side of the Kauravas. That is why he upheld Bheeshma\u2019s vow by breaking his own. Bheeshma resolved on a particular day during the war, that before sunset on the next day, he would either kill Arjun, the foremost Pandava warrior, or else to save him, Shree Krishna would have to break his own vow of not lifting weapons in the battle of Mahabharat. Poets describe the vow that Bheeshma made:\u0101ju jo harihi\u1e45 na \u015bhastra gah\u0101\u016b\u00f1,tau l\u0101jahu\u00f1 ga\u1e45g\u0101 janan\u012b ko \u015bh\u0101ntanu suta na kah\u0101\u016b\u00f1(Saint Tulsidas) [v2]\u201cIf I do not make the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna lift weapons, then I will shame my mother Ganga, and I am not the son of King Shantanu.\u201d Bheeshma fought so valiantly that Arjun\u2019s chariot was shattered, and he was stranded on the ground. At that stage, Shree Krishna lifted the chariot wheel and came forward to prevent Bheeshma from killing Arjun. Bheeshma saw the Lord with the chariot wheel in his hand as a weapon, and broke into a big smile. He understood that Bhaktavatsala Bhagav\u0101n (God who gives pleasure to his devotees) had broken his own vow to honor the vow of his devotee.In fact, Bheeshma\u2019s devotion to Lord Krishna had a very rasik (full of sweetness) flavor to it. He used to meditate on Shree Krishna\u2019s pastimes in Vrindavan. There, in the evening when the Lord would return to the village after grazing the cows in the forest, the dust raised from the hooves of the cows would deck his charming face, increasing its beauty and sweetness. During the battle of Mahabharat, the dust raised from the hooves of the horses too added to Shree Krishna\u2019s beauty, and he loved having dar\u015bhan (divine vision) of his Lord there.In the last stage of his life, as he lay for six months on the bed of arrows, he meditated on that very vision of God, offering the following prayer to Him:yudhi turaga-rajo-vidh\u016bmra-vi\u1e63hvak-kacha-lulita-\u015bhramav\u0101ry-ala\u1e45k\u1e5bit\u0101syemama ni\u015bhita-\u015bharair vibhidyam\u0101na-tvachi vilasat-kavache \u2019stu k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a \u0101tm\u0101(Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.34) [v3]\u201cOn the battlefield, Lord Krishna\u2019s flowing hair was covered with white dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and his face was covered with sweat beads because of his physical effort in driving the chariot. These were like ornaments enhancing the beauty of my Lord; and the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows further intensified the decorations. Let my mind meditate unto that Shree Krishna.\u201dLord Krishna reciprocated his loving devotion by himself coming to meet Bheeshma on his deathbed of arrows, and with the dar\u015bhan of God in front of him, Bheeshma, the great mah\u0101jan, left his body, of his own volition."

Arjun pleads to Shree Krishna that he has been overpowered by k\u0101rpa\u1e47ya do\u1e63h, or the flaw of cowardice in behavior, and so he requests the Lord to become his Guru and instruct him about the path of auspiciousness.All the Vedic scriptures declare in unison that it is through the medium of a Spiritual Master that we receive divine knowledge for our eternal welfare:tadvij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurumev\u0101bhigachchhet samitp\u0101\u1e47i\u1e25 \u015bhrotriya\u1e41 brahmani\u1e63h\u1e6dham (Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had 1.2.12) [v4]\u201cTo know the Absolute Truth, approach a Guru who is both a knower of the scriptures and is practically situated on the platform of God-realization.\u201dtasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015bhreya uttamam\u015bh\u0101bde pare cha ni\u1e63h\u1e47\u0101ta\u1e41 brahma\u1e47y upa\u015bham\u0101\u015bhrayam(Bh\u0101gavatam 11.3.21) [v5]\u201cSeekers of the Truth should surrender themselves to a Spiritual Master who has understood the conclusion of the scriptures and taken complete shelter of God, leaving aside all material considerations.\u201dThe Ramayan states:guru binu bhava nidhi tarai na ko\u012b, jau\u1e45 biranchi sankara sama ho\u012b. [v6]\u201cNot even the most elevated of spiritual aspirants can cross over the material ocean without the grace of the Guru.\u201d Shree Krishna states this himself in the Bhagavad Gita in verse 4.34: \u201cLearn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201dTo demonstrate the need for accepting a Guru to gain knowledge, Shree Krishna himself took this step. In his youth, he went to the hermitage of Sandipani Muni to learn sixty-four sciences from him. His classmate, Sudama, remarked regarding this:yasya chchhando maya\u1e41 brahma deha \u0101vapana\u1e41 vibho\u015bhreyas\u0101\u1e41 tasya guru\u1e63hu v\u0101so \u2019tyanta vi\u1e0dambanam(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.80.45) [v7]\u201cO Shree Krishna, the Vedas are like your body, manifested from the knowledge that you possess (hence, what requirement do you have for making a Guru). Yet, you too pretend you need to learn from a Guru; this is only your divine leela (pastime).\u201d Shree Krishna is in fact the first Guru of the world, because he is the Guru of Brahma, the first-born in this material world. He performed this leela for our benefit, to teach by his example that we souls, who are under the influence of Maya, will need a Guru to dispel our ignorance. In this verse, Arjun takes the step of surrendering to Shree Krishna as his disciple, and requests his Guru to enlighten him regarding the proper course of action."

Since Arjun\u2019s problems are looming bigger than his feeble intellectual abilities, his material knowledge is insufficient in saving him from the ocean of grief that he finds himself in. Having accepted Shree Krishna as his Guru, Arjun now pours out his heart to him, to reveal his pitiable state.Arjun\u2019s situation is not unique. This is invariably the situation we sometimes find ourselves in as we go through the journey of life. We want happiness, but we experience misery; we desire knowledge, but are unable to lift the cloud of ignorance; we crave perfect love, but repeatedly meet with disappointment. Our college degrees, acquired knowledge, and mundane scholarships do not provide solutions to these perplexities of life. We need divine knowledge to solve the puzzle of life. That treasure chest of divine knowledge is opened when we find a true Guru, one who is situated in transcendence, provided we have the humility to learn from him. Such is the path Arjun has decided to take."

Such is the equanimous attitude exhibited by someone with knowledge in all situations.With our incomplete understanding, we find faults with the situations we are in\u2014we complain and grumble about them, wish to run away from them, and hold them responsible for our misery. But the enlightened souls inform us that the world created by God is perfect in every way, and both good and bad situations come to us for a divine purpose. They are all arranged for our spiritual evolution, to push us upward in our journey toward perfection. Those who understand this secret are never disturbed in difficult circumstances, facing them with serenity and tranquility.\u201cThe snowflakes fall slowly to the ground, each flake in its proper place\u201d is a famous Taoist expression. It beautifully expresses the inherent perfection in the design of the world and the macro events taking place in it, even though we are not able to perceive it from our material perspective.The Chh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63had explains why earthquakes, hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and typhoons are created in the world by God, as a part of the grand scheme of things. It states that God deliberately creates difficult situations to prevent people from slowing down in their journey of spiritual progress. When people become complacent, a natural calamity comes along, forcing the souls to strain their abilities to cope with it, which ensures their progress. However, it must be noted that the progress being talked about here is not the external increase of material luxuries, but the internal unfoldment of the glorious divinity of the soul over a continuum of lifetime."

        "commentary": "Starting with this verse, Shree Krishna initiates his discourse with a dramatic opening statement. Arjun is lamenting, for what he feels are very valid reasons. But, rather than commiserating with him, Shree Krishna takes the wind out of his arguments. He says, \u201cArjun, though you may feel you are speaking words of wisdom, you are actually speaking and acting out of ignorance. No possible reason justifies lamentation. The Pundits\u2014those who are wise\u2014never lament, neither for the living nor for the dead. Hence the grief you visualize in killing your relatives is illusory, and it proves that you are not a Pundit.\u201dOne does not need to go far into the Gita to find a wise person above lamentation, for Grandsire Bheeshma himself was the perfect example. He was a sage who had fathomed the mysteries of life and death, and risen above the dualities of circumstances. Serene in any eventuality, he had even consented to taking the side of the wicked, if it served the Lord. He thus demonstrated that those who are surrendered to God simply do their duty in all situations, without being affected by outcomes. Such persons never lament because they accept all circumstances as God\u2019s grace."

A local legend goes like this. Once, Socrates was walking on the street, absorbed in deep philosophic contemplation, when he accidentally bumped into someone. That man blurted in annoyance, \u201cCan\u2019t you see where you walk? Who are you?\u201d Socrates answered with amusement, \u201cMy dear fellow, I have been pondering over that question for the last forty years. If you ever come to know who I am, please let me know.\u201dIn the Vedic tradition, whenever divine knowledge is imparted, it usually begins with knowledge of the self. Shree Krishna follows the same approach in the Bhagavad Gita, with a piece of information that would have swept Socrates off his feet. Shree Krishna begins by explaining that the entity that we call the \u201cself\u201d is really the soul, not the material body, and is eternal, just as God himself is eternal. The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had states:j\u00f1\u0101j\u00f1au dw\u0101vaj\u0101 v\u012b\u015bhan\u012b\u015bh\u0101vaj\u0101 hyek\u0101 bhokt\u1e5bi bhogy\u0101rtha yukt\u0101ananta\u015bhch\u0101tm\u0101 vi\u015bhwar\u016bpo hyakart\u0101 traya\u1e41 yad\u0101 vindate brahmametat (1.9) [v9]The above verse states that creation is a combination of three entities\u2014God, soul, and Maya\u2014and all the three entities are eternal.

        "commentary": "With immaculate logic, Shree Krishna establishes the principle of transmigration of the soul from lifetime to lifetime. He explains that in one lifetime itself, we change bodies from childhood to youth to maturity and then to old age. In fact, modern science informs us that cells within the body undergo regeneration\u2014old cells die away and new ones take their place. It is estimated that within seven years, practically all the cells of the body change. Further, the molecules within the cells change even more rapidly. With every breath we inhale, oxygen molecules are absorbed into our cells via the metabolic processes, and molecules that were heretofore locked within the cells are released as carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that in one year\u2019s time, about ninety-eight percent of our bodily molecules change. And yet, despite the continual change of the body, we perceive that we are the same person. That is because we are not the material body, but the spiritual soul seated within.In this verse, the word deha means \u201cthe body\u201d and dehi means \u201cpossessor of the body,\u201d or the soul. Shree Krishna draws Arjun\u2019s attention to the fact that, since the body is constantly changing, in one lifetime itself, the soul passes through many bodies. Similarly, at the time of death, it passes into another body. Actually, what we term as \u201cdeath\u201d in worldly parlance is merely the soul discarding its old dysfunctional body, and what we call \u201cbirth\u201d is the soul taking on a new body elsewhere. This is the principle of reincarnation.Most Oriental philosophies accept this concept of reincarnation. It is an integral part of Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In Buddhism, the Buddha made references to his past lives repeatedly. Many people do not know the extent to which reincarnation was a part of the belief system of the Occidental philosophies as well. In ancient classical Western religious and philosophic circles, famous thinkers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Socrates accepted reincarnation to be true, and their views were also reflected in Orphism, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism. Within the mainstream Abrahamic faiths, mystics of the three major religions also supported reincarnation. Examples include Jews who studied the Kabbalah, the Christian Cathars, and Muslim Shia sects such as the Alawi Shias and the Druze. For example, amongst Occidental religions, Josephus, the great ancient Jewish historian, used language in his writings that seem to ascribe belief in some form of reincarnation among the Pharisees and Essenes of his day. Certainly the Jewish Kabbalah prescribes to the idea of reincarnation as gilgul neshamot, or the \u201crolling of the soul.\u201d The great Sufi mystic, Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi declared:I died out of the stone and I became a plant;I died out of the plant and became an animal;I died out of the animal and became a man.Why then should I fear to die?When did I grow less by dying?I shall die out of man and shall become an angel!\u201d [v10]Many of the early Christians believed in the concept of reincarnation. Christian history informs us that, in the 553 AD, the Council of Nicaea, a conclave, was held to discuss the principle of reincarnation, and it was thereafter declared a heresy, apparently to increase the authority of the Church over the lives of the people. Until then, it was commonly accepted. Jesus indirectly proclaimed this doctrine when he told his disciples that John the Baptist was Elijah the Prophet reincarnated (Matthew 11:13-14, Matthew 17:10-13). This is also mentioned in the Old Testament (Malachi 4:5). Origen, the most learned of the Christian Fathers, declared: \u201cEvery man receives a body for himself according to his deserts in former lives [v11].\u201d Solomon\u2019s Book of Wisdom says: \u201cTo be born in sound body with sound limbs is a reward of the virtues of the past lives.\u201d (Wisdom of Solomon 8:19-20) [v12]Belief in reincarnation is also found in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Siberia, West Africa, North America, and Australia. Moving to more recent centuries and civilizations, reincarnation has been affirmed by Rosicrucians, Spiritism, Theosophists, and New Age followers. Even more recently, it has even been studied in serious scientific circles at major universities, exemplified by the works of Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker, both at the University of Virginia.Without accepting the concept of rebirth, it is difficult to make sense out of the suffering, chaos, and incompleteness of the world, and hence, many famous western thinkers believed in this principle. Virgil and Ovid regarded this doctrine as self-evident. The German philosophers Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, and Lessing accepted it. Amongst the more recent philosophers, Hume, Spencer, and Max Mueller, all recognized it as an incontrovertible doctrine. Among Western poets, Browing, Rosetti, Tennyson, and Wordsworth, to mention just a few, all believed in it.Shree Krishna has previously declared that the wise do not lament. But the fact remains that we do experience happiness and distress. What is the reason for it? He now explains this concept."

        "commentary": "The human body houses five senses\u2014the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing\u2014and these, in contact with their objects of perception, give rise to sensations of happiness and distress. None of these sensations is permanent. They come and go like the changing seasons. Although cool water provides pleasure in the summer, the same water gives distress in the winter. Thus, both the perceptions of happiness and distress experienced through the senses are transitory. If we permit ourselves to be affected by them, we will sway like a pendulum from side to side. A person of discrimination should practice to tolerate both the feelings of happiness and distress without being disturbed by them.The technique of Vipassan\u0101, which is the primary technique of self-realization in Buddhism, is based on this principle of tolerance of sense perceptions. Its practice helps eliminate desire, which, as stated in the four noble truths (the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation), is the cause of all suffering. This is not surprising considering that Buddhist philosophy is a subset of the vast Vedic philosophy."

        "commentary": "In the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that both the sensations of happiness and distress are fleeting. He now encourages Arjun to rise above these dualities through discrimination. In order to develop this discrimination, we first need to understand the answers to two important questions: 1) Why do we aspire for happiness? 2) Why doesn\u2019t material happiness satisfy us?The answer to the first question is very simple. God is an ocean of infinite bliss, and we souls are his tiny parts. This basically means that we are tiny fragments of an infinite ocean of bliss. Swami Vivekananda would address people by saying, \u201cO ye children of immortal bliss.\u201d Just as a child is drawn to his or her mother, each part is naturally drawn toward its whole. Similarly, being infinitesimal parts of the ocean of bliss, we souls too are drawn to this bliss. Hence, everything we do in the world is for the sake of happiness. We all may have different views regarding where happiness lies or what form it might take, but all living beings seek nothing apart from it. This answers the first question.Now, let\u2019s understand the answer to the second question. The soul, being a tiny part of God, is divine in nature like God himself. Hence the happiness that the soul seeks is also divine. Such happiness must possess the following three characteristics:It must be infinite in extent.It must be permanent.It must be ever-fresh.Such is the happiness of God, which is described as sat-chit-\u0101nand, or eternal-sentient-ocean of bliss. However, the happiness we experience from the contact of the senses with their objects is the reverse; it is temporary, finite, and insentient. Thus, the material happiness that we perceive through the body can never satisfy the divine soul.With this discrimination, we must practice to tolerate the perception of material happiness. Similarly, we must tolerate the sensation of material distress. (This second aspect is discussed in detail in many future verses, such as 2.48, 5.20, etc.) Only then will we rise above these dualities and the material energy will no longer bind us."

God is everlasting. Thus he is sat (eternally existing). Hence, a name for him in the Vedas is sat-chit-\u0101nand (eternal-full of knowledge-ocean of bliss).2. The soul is imperishable, and hence it is sat. However, the body will cease to exist one day, and hence it is asat (temporary). The soul is also sat-chit-\u0101nand, but it is also a\u1e47u (tiny). Hence the soul is a\u1e47u sat, a\u1e47u chit, and a\u1e47u \u0101nand.3. The entity Maya from which the world has been made is eternal, or sat. However, all material objects we see around us came into existence and will be destroyed with time. Thus, they can all be termed as asat, or temporary. So while the world itself is asat, it is only the entity Maya that is sat.When we say that the world is asat, this should not be confused with mithy\u0101. Asat (temporary) does not mean mithy\u0101 (non-existent). Some philosophers claim that the world is mithy\u0101, or \u201cnon-existent.\u201d They assert that it is only the ignorance within us that is making us perceive the world, and once we are situated in brahma-j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge of the Supreme) the world will cease to exist. However, if this were true, then the world should no longer have remained for the God-realized Saints. Since they had destroyed their ignorance, the world should have stopped existing for them. Why then did these Saints write books even after attaining the state of God-realization? Where did the paper and pen come from? The fact that brahma-j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs use the objects of the world proves that the world exists even for them. Besides, even brahma-j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs need food to nourish their bodies. The Vedic scriptures state: pa\u015bhv\u0101dibhi\u015bhch\u0101vi\u015bhe\u1e63hat [v16] \u201cEven God-realized Saints feels hungry, just as animals do, and need to eat food.\u201d If the world does not exist for them, then how and why should they eat?Further, the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had repeatedly informs us that God is all-pervading in the world:so \u2019k\u0101mayata bahu sy\u0101\u1e41 praj\u0101yeyeti sa tapo \u2019tapyata sa tapastaptv\u0101 ida\u1e41sarvamas\u1e5bijata yadida\u1e41 ki\u1e41 cha tats\u1e5bi\u1e63htv\u0101 tadev\u0101nupr\u0101vi\u1e63hat tadanupravi\u015bhya sachcha tyachch\u0101bhavat nirukta\u1e41 ch\u0101nirukta\u1e41 cha nilayana\u1e41 ch\u0101nilayna\u1e41 cha vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 ch\u0101vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 cha satya\u1e41 ch\u0101n\u1e5bitam cha satyamabhavat yadida\u1e41 ki\u1e41 cha tatsatyamity\u0101chak\u1e63hate tadapye\u1e63ha \u015bhloko bhavati (2.6.4) [v17]This Vedic mantra states that God not only created the world, but also permeates every atom of it.

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna establishes the relationship between the body and the soul, by saying that the soul pervades the body. What does he mean by this? The soul is sentient, i.e. it possesses consciousness. The body is made from insentient matter, devoid of consciousness. However, the soul passes on the quality of consciousness to the body as well, by residing in it. Hence, the soul pervades the body by spreading its consciousness everywhere in it.Some raise a question here regarding the location of the soul. The Vedas state that the soul resides in the heart:h\u1e5bidi hye\u1e63ha \u0101tm\u0101 (Pra\u015bhnopani\u1e63had 3.6) [v18]sa v\u0101 e\u1e63ha \u0101tm\u0101 h\u1e5bidi (Chh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63had 8.3.3) [v19]The word h\u1e5bidi indicates that the soul is seated in the region of the heart. Yet, consciousness, which is the symptom of the soul, spreads throughout the body. How does this happen? Ved Vyas explains this concept as follows: avirodha\u015bhchandanavat  (Brahma S\u016btra 2.3.23) [v20]\u201cJust as applying sandalwood to your forehead cools the entire body, similarly, the soul, although residing locally in the heart, infuses its consciousness throughout the body.\u201dAgain, someone may ask that if consciousness is a characteristic of the soul, then how does it spread into the body? This question has also been answered by Ved Vyas:vyaktireko gandhavat (Brahma S\u016btra 2.3.26) [v21]\u201cFragrance is a quality of the flower. But the garden where the flower grows also becomes fragrant.\u201d This means that the flower is able to pass on its fragrant quality to the garden. Likewise, the soul is sentient, and it also makes the dead matter of the body sentient, by pervading its consciousness in it."

Either it is burnt, in which case it is converted to ashes and becomes mud. Or it is buried, in which case insects eat it and transform it into mud. Else, it is thrown into the river, in which case the sea creatures make it their fodder and excrete it as waste, which ultimately merges with the mud of the seabed.In this manner, mud undergoes an amazing cycle in the world. It gets transformed into edibles, bodies are made from these edibles, and the bodies return back into the mud of the earth. The Bible states: \u201cFor dust thou are, and unto dust thou shalt return.\u201d (Genesis 3:19)[v22] This phrase refers to the material body. Shree Krishna tells Arjun, \u201cWithin that material body is an eternal imperishable entity, which is not made of mud. That is the divine soul, the real self.\u201d"

        "commentary": "The illusion of death is created because we identify ourselves with the body. The Ramayan explains this as follows:jau\u1e45 sapane\u1e45 sira k\u0101\u1e6dai ko\u012b, binu j\u0101ge\u1e45 na d\u016bri dukh ho\u012b. [v23]\u201cIf we dream of our head getting cut, we will perceive its pain until we wake up.\u201d The incident in the dream is an illusion, but the experience of the pain continues to torment until we wake up and dispel the illusion. Similarly, in the illusion that we are the body, we fear the experience of death. For the enlightened soul whose illusion has been dispelled, this fear of death vanishes.One may ask that if nobody can kill anyone, then why is murder considered a punishable offense? The answer is that the body is the vehicle of the soul, and destroying any living being\u2019s vehicle is violence, which is forbidden. The Vedas clearly instruct: m\u0101 hinsy\u0101t sarvabh\u016bt\u0101ni [v24] \u201cDo not commit violence toward anyone.\u201d In fact, the Vedas even consider killing of animals as a crime. However, there are occasions where the rules change and even violence becomes necessary. For example, in cases where a snake is approaching to bite, or if one is attacked with lethal weapons, or one\u2019s life sustenance is being snatched away, then violence is permitted for self-protection. In the present situation, what is appropriate for Arjun, violence or non-violence, and why? Shree Krishna will explain this to him in great detail, as the dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita progresses. And in the course of the explanation, priceless divine knowledge will be revealed to shed light on the subject."

        "commentary": "Continuing to explain the nature of the soul, Shree Krishna reiterates the concept of rebirth, comparing it to an everyday activity. When garments become torn and useless, we discard them in favor of new ones, but in doing so we do not change ourselves. In the same manner, the soul remains unchanged, when it discards its worn-out body and takes birth in a new body elsewhere.The Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan gives the following argument to prove the existence of rebirth:j\u0101tasya har\u1e63habhaya\u015bhoka sampratipatte\u1e25 (3.1.18) [v27]It states that if you observe a little baby, you will find it sometimes becomes happy, sometimes sad, and sometimes fearful, without any apparent reason. According to the Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan, the little baby is remembering its past life, and hence experiencing these emotions. However, as it grows up, the impressions of the present life are imprinted so strongly upon its mind, that they erase most past memories. Besides, the processes of death and birth are also so painful to the soul that they erase a substantial portion of the past life\u2019s memories.The Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan gives another argument in support of rebirth: stany\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63h\u0101t (3.1.21) [v28] It says that a newborn baby has no knowledge of language. How then can a mother teach her baby to suckle her breast when she inserts it in the baby\u2019s mouth? However, the newborn child has drunk milk in infinite past lifetimes, even in animal forms, from the breasts, teats, and udders of innumerable mothers. Hence, when the mother puts her breast in the baby\u2019s mouth, it automatically starts suckling based on past practice.Without accepting the concept of rebirth, the disparity between human beings becomes inexplicable and irrational. For example, let us suppose one man is blind from birth. If that person asks why he was punished in this way, what logical answer can be given to him? If we say it was a result of his karmas, he may argue that the present life is the only life he has, and therefore, there are no past karmas at the time of birth that should afflict him. If we say it was the will of God, it would also seem implausible, since God is all-merciful and would not unnecessarily want anyone to be blind. The only logical explanation is that the person was born blind as a consequence of karmas from past lives. Thus, from common sense and on the authority of the scriptures we are obliged to believe in the concept of rebirth."

This verse needs to be understood in the context of the philosophical streams existing in India and their divergent understandings about the nature of self. Indian philosophy has historically comprised of twelve schools of thought. Six of these accept the authority of the Vedas, and hence they are called \u0100stik Dar\u015bhans. These are M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101, Ved\u0101nt, Ny\u0101ya, Vai\u015bhe\u1e63hik, S\u0101nkhya, and Yog. Within each of these are more branches\u2014for example, the Ved\u0101nt school of thought is further divided into six schools\u2014Adavita v\u0101da, Dwaita v\u0101da, Vi\u015bhi\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101dvaita v\u0101da, Vi\u015bhuddhadvaita v\u0101da, Dwait\u0101dvaita v\u0101da, and Achintya-bhed\u0101bheda v\u0101da. Each of these has further branches, for example, Advaita v\u0101da is subdivided into D\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e6di-s\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e6di v\u0101da, Avachchheda v\u0101da, Bimba-pratibimba v\u0101da, Vivarta v\u0101da, Aj\u0101ta v\u0101da, etc. We will not go into the details of these schools here. Let it suffice for now to know that all these schools of thought accept the Vedas as the authority of reference. Accordingly, they all accept the eternal, unchangeable soul as the self.The remaining six schools of Indian philosophy do not accept the authority of the Vedas. These are Ch\u0101rv\u0101k v\u0101da, the four Buddhist schools (Yog\u0101ch\u0101r v\u0101da, M\u0101dhyamik v\u0101da, Vaibh\u0101\u015bhik v\u0101da, and Saut\u0101ntrik v\u0101da), and Jainism. Each of these has its own explanation for the nature of the self. Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka v\u0101da states that the body itself comprises the self, and consciousness is merely a product of the conglomeration of its constituents. Jainism states that the soul is the same size as the body, and hence, it is subject to change from birth to birth. The Buddhist schools of thought do not accept the existence of a permanent soul, and instead maintain that there is a stream of renewed animation from lifetime to lifetime, which ensures continuity of the individual.It seems that at the time of Shree Krishna too, versions of the Buddhist philosophy of renewed animation and non-permanence of the soul existed. Hence he is explaining that even if Arjun subscribes to this philosophy of renewed animation of the self from life to life, there is still no reason to lament. Why should one not lament? This is now explained in the next verse."

Psychologists categorize the fear of death as the biggest fear in life. In Patanjali\u2019s Yog Dar\u015bhan too, abhinive\u015bh, or the instinctive urge to survive at all costs, is mentioned as a trait of the material intellect. But for one who has taken birth, death is inevitable. So when something is inevitable, why lament over it?The Mahabharat relates an incident regarding this. During the period of their exile in the forest, one day while wandering the five Pandavas were thirsty and came across a well. Yudhishthir asked Bheem to go and fetch water for all of them. When Bheem reached the well, a yak\u1e63ha (semi-celestial being) began speaking from inside the well, \u201cI will only let you take the water if you first answer my questions.\u201d Bheem paid no heed and proceeded to draw water. The yak\u1e63ha pulled him in. After some time when Bheem did not return, a concerned Yudhishthir sent Arjun to see what was happening and fetch water. When Arjun reached the well, the yak\u1e63ha asked him too, \u201cI have already seized your brother. Do not attempt to draw the water unless you can answer all my questions correctly.\u201d Arjun also paid no heed, and the yak\u1e63ha pulled him into the well. The other brothers, Nakul and Sahadev, followed him, but met with the same fate. Finally, Yudhishthir himself came to the well. Once again, the yak\u1e63ha said, \u201cAnswer my questions if you want to drink water from the well, or I will pull you in, just as I have done to your four brothers.\u201d Yudhisthir agreed to answer the questions. The yak\u1e63ha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disguise. He asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir. One of these questions was: kim \u0101\u015bhcharya\u1e41? \u201cWhat is the most surprising thing in this world?\u201d Yudhisthir replied:ahany ahani bh\u016bt\u0101ni gachchhant\u012bha yam\u0101layam\u015bhe\u1e63h\u0101\u1e25 sthiratvam ichchhanti kim\u0101\u015bhcharyamata\u1e25 param (Mahabharat) [v30]\u201cAt every moment people are dying. Those who are alive are witnessing this phenomenon, and yet they do not think that one day they will also have to die.

The cause for lamentation is only attachment that arises out of illusion.\u201dIn the material realm, each individual soul is bound by three bodies\u2014gross body, subtle body, causal body.Gross body: Consists of the five gross elements of nature\u2014earth, water, fire, air, and space.Subtle body: Consists of eighteen elements\u2014five life-airs, five working senses, five knowledge senses, mind, intellect, and ego.Causal body: Consists of the account of karmas from endless past lives, including the sansk\u0101rs (tendencies) carried forward from previous lives.At the time of death, the soul discards its gross body, and departs with the subtle and causal bodies. God again gives the soul another gross body according to its subtle and causal bodies, and sends the soul into a suitable mother\u2019s womb for the purpose. After the soul gives up one gross body, there is a transitional phase before it receives a new gross body. This could be a few seconds in duration or a few years long. So before birth, the soul existed with the unmanifest subtle and causal bodies. After death, it still exists in the unmanifest state. It only becomes manifest in the middle. So death is no reason for grief."

Considering oneself to be the soul, the prescribed duty is to love and serve God with devotion. This is called para dharma.

These duties are defined according to one\u2019s \u0101\u015bhram (station in life), and var\u1e47a (occupation). They are called apara dharma, or mundane duties. This distinction between spiritual duties and material duties needs to be kept in mind while understanding the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedic philosophy at large.By occupation, Arjun was a warrior, and so his occupational duty as a warrior was to fight for the protection of righteousness.

The occupational duties of warriors demand that they be brave and even willing to lay down their lives, if required, for the protection of society. During Vedic times, while killing animals was forbidden for the rest of society, warriors were allowed to go into the forest and practice warfare by killing animals. Such chivalrous warriors were expected to welcome the opportunity to defend righteousness with open arms. The discharge of their duty would be rewarded as a virtuous act in this life and the next.The proper discharge of one\u2019s occupational duties is not a spiritual act in itself, and it does not result in God-realization. It is merely a virtuous deed with positive material rewards. Shree Krishna brings his instructions a step lower and says that even if Arjun is not interested in spiritual teachings, and wishes to remain at the bodily platform, then also his social duty as a warrior is to defend righteousness.As we can see, the Bhagavad Gita is a call to action, not to inaction. When people are exposed to lectures on spirituality, they often question, \u201cAre you asking me to give up my work?\u201d However, verse after verse, Shree Krishna is giving Arjun the reverse instruction. While Arjun wishes to abandon his duty, Shree Krishna repeatedly coaxes him to discharge it.

Such an attitude to work will release him from any sinful reactions.When we work with selfish motives, we create karmas, which bring about their subsequent karmic reactions. The M\u0101\u1e6dhar \u015ahruti states:pu\u1e47yena pu\u1e47ya loka\u1e41 nayati p\u0101pena p\u0101pamubh\u0101bhy\u0101meva manu\u1e63hyalokam [v34]\u201cIf you do good deeds, you will go to the celestial abodes; if you do bad deeds, you will go to the nether regions; if you do a mixture of both, you will come back to the planet Earth.\u201d In either case, we get bound by the reactions of our karmas. Thus, mundane good deeds are also binding. They result in material rewards, which add to the stockpile of our karmas and thicken the illusion that there is happiness in the world.However, if we give up selfish motives, then our actions no longer create any karmic reactions. For example, murder is a sin, and the judicial law of every country of the world declares it to be a punishable offence. But if a policeman in the discharge of his duty kills the leader of a gang of bandits, he is not punished for it. If a soldier kills an enemy soldier in battle, he is not punished for it. In fact, he can even be awarded a medal for bravery. The reason for apparent lack of punishment is that these actions are not motivated by any ill-will or personal motive; they are performed as a matter of duty to the country. God\u2019s law is quite similar. If one gives up all selfish motives and works merely for the sake of duty toward the Supreme, such work does not create any karmic reactions.So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to become detached from outcomes and simply focus on doing his duty. When he fights with the attitude of equanimity, treating victory and defeat, pleasure and pain as the same, then despite killing his enemies, he will never incur sin. This subject is also repeated later in the Bhagavad Gita, in verse 5.10: \u201cJust as a lotus leaf is untouched by water, those who dedicate all their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin.\u201dHaving declared a profound conclusion about work without attachment, Shree Krishna now says that he will explain the science of work in detail, to reveal the logic behind what he has said."

It lists twenty-four entities: pa\u00f1ch-mah\u0101bh\u016bta (earth, water, fire, air, and sky), pa\u00f1ch tanm\u0101tr\u0101 (the five abstract qualities of matter\u2014taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight), pa\u00f1ch karmendriya (five working senses), pa\u00f1ch j\u00f1\u0101nendriya (five knowledge senses), mind, ahank\u0101r (the entity created by the evolution of mah\u0101n), mah\u0101n (the entity created by evolution of prak\u1e5biti), prak\u1e5biti (the primordial form of the material energy). Apart from these is puru\u1e63h or the soul, which tries to enjoy prak\u1e5biti, and gets bound in it.Shree Krishna has just explained to Arjun another form of S\u0101nkhya, which is the analytical knowledge of the immortal soul. He now says that he is going to reveal the science of working without desire for rewards. This requires detachment from the fruits of actions. Such detachment comes by practicing discrimination with the intellect. Hence, Shree Krishna has interestingly called it buddhi yog, or \u201cYog of the Intellect.\u201d In subsequent verses (2.41 and 2.44), he goes on to explain how the intellect plays an important role in bringing the mind to a state of detachment."

        "commentary": "The great danger we face is that we may not get the human form in the next life, and instead go into the lower species of life, such as animals, birds, the nether regions, etc. We cannot be complacent that the human form will remain reserved for us, for the next birth will be determined by our karmas and level of consciousness in this life.There are 8.4 million species of life in existence. The species below human beings\u2014animals, birds, fishes, insects, birds, etc.\u2014do not have an evolved intellect as we humans do. Yet, they also perform commonplace activities such as eating, sleeping, defending, and mating. Human beings have been endowed with the faculty of knowledge, for a higher purpose, so that they may utilize it to elevate themselves. If humans utilize their intellects merely for doing the animalistic activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, in a deluxe way, it is a misuse of the human form. For example, if someone makes eating as the primary pleasure of life, then the body of a pig becomes more suitable for such a person, and thus, that individual receives a pig\u2019s body in the next life. If someone makes sleeping the goal of life, then God deems that the body of a polar bear is more suitable for such activity and allots it in the succeeding life. So the great danger before us is that we may not get a human birth in the next life. The Vedas state:iha chedaved\u012bdatha satyamasti na chedih\u0101ved\u012bnmahat\u012b vina\u1e63h\u1e6dhi\u1e25(Kenopani\u1e63had 2.5) [v35]\u201cO human being, the human birth is a rare opportunity. If you do not utilize it to achieve your goal, you will suffer great ruin.\u201d Again, they state:iha cheda\u015bhakad boddhu\u1e41 pr\u0101k\u015bhar\u012brasya visrasa\u1e25tata\u1e25 sarge\u1e63hu loke\u1e63hu \u015bhar\u012bratv\u0101ya kalpate (Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had 2.3.4) [v36]\u201cIf you do not strive for God-realization in this life, you will continue to rotate in the 8.4 million species of life for many births.\u201dHowever, once we commence on the journey of spiritual practice then even if we do not complete the path in this life, God sees that our intention to do so existed. Therefore, he grants us the human birth again, to enable us to continue from where we had left off. In this way, we avert the great danger.Also, Shree Krishna says that no loss ever comes from endeavor made on this path. This is because whatever material assets we accumulate in the present life have to be left behind at the time of death. But if we make any spiritual advancement on the path of Yog, God preserves it, and gives us the fruits in the next life, enabling us to start off from where we had left. Thus, having informed Arjun about its benefits, Shree Krishna now begins instructing him about the science of working without attachment."

        "commentary": "Attachment is a function of the mind. Its manifestation is that the mind repeatedly runs toward the object of its attachment, which could be persons, sensual objects, prestige, bodily comfort, situations, and so on. So if thoughts of some person or object repeatedly come to the mind, it is a possible indication of the mind being attached to it. However, if it is the mind that gets attached, then why is Shree Krishna bringing the intellect into the topic of attachment? Is there any role of the intellect in eliminating attachment?Within our body is the subtle anta\u1e25 kara\u1e47, which we also colloquially refer to as the heart. It consists of the mind, the intellect, and the ego. In this subtle machine, the intellect is superior to the mind. It makes decisions while the mind creates desires and gets attached to the object of affection as determined by the intellect. For instance, if the intellect decides that money is the source of happiness, the mind hankers for wealth. If the intellect decides that prestige is the most important thing in life, the mind craves for reputation and fame. In other words, the mind develops desires in accordance with the knowledge of the intellect.Throughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect. While sitting at home, we adopt informal postures in which the mind finds comfort. Yet, we adopt appropriate formal postures while sitting in the office. It is not that the mind enjoys the formality of the office\u2014given its way, it would rather embrace the informality of home. However, the intellect decides that formal behavior is necessary in the office. So the intellect controls the mind, and people sit formally all day long, following the decorum of the workplace, against the nature of the mind. Similarly, the mind does not enjoy doing office work\u2014if it had its way, it would rather sit at home and watch television. But the intellect rules that working in office is necessary to earn a living. Therefore, the intellect again reins in the natural tendency of the mind, and people work eight hours a day, or longer.The above examples illustrate that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind. Thus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction. Buddhi yog is the art of detaching the mind from the fruits of actions, by developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work is meant for the pleasure of God. Such a person of resolute intellect cultivates single-minded focus on the goal, and traverses the path like an arrow released from the bow. This resolve becomes so strong in higher stages of s\u0101dhan\u0101 that nothing can deter the s\u0101dhak from treading the path. He or she thinks, \u201cEven if there are millions of obstacles on my path, even if the whole world condemns me, even if I have to lay down my life, I will still not give up my s\u0101dhan\u0101.\u201d But those whose intellect is many-branched find their mind running in various directions. They are unable to develop the focus of mind that is required to tread the path to God."

        "commentary": "The material energy binds the divine soul to the bodily conception of life, by its three constituent modes. These modes of material nature are sattva (mode of goodness), rajas (mode of passion), and tamas (mode of ignorance). The relative proportion of the three modes varies for every individual, due their sansk\u0101rs (tendencies) from countless past lives, and accordingly, everyone has different inclinations and tendencies. The Vedic scriptures accept this disparity and give suitable instructions for all kinds of people. If the \u015bh\u0101stras did not contain instructions for worldly-minded people, they would have gone further astray. So, the Vedas offer them material rewards for the performance of rigorous rituals, helping them rise from the mode of ignorance to passion, and from passion to goodness.Thus, the Vedas contain both kinds of knowledge\u2014ritualistic ceremonies for the materially attached and divine knowledge for spiritual aspirants. When Shree Krishna tells Arjun to reject the Vedas, the statement needs to be understood in the context of the preceding and following verses. He is implying that Arjun should not be attracted by the section of the Vedas that propounds rules, regulations, and ceremonies for material rewards. Instead, he should use the divine section of the Vedic knowledge to elevate himself to the level of Absolute Truth."

        "commentary": "This is an extremely popular verse of the Bhagavad Gita, so much so that even most school children in India are familiar with it. It offers deep insight into the proper spirit of work and is often quoted whenever the topic of karm yog is discussed. The verse gives four instructions regarding the science of work: 1) Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. 2) The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. 3) Even while working, give up the pride of doership. 4) Do not be attached to inaction.Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. We have the right to do our duty, but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts. A number of factors come into play in determining the results\u2014our efforts, destiny (our past karmas), the will of God, the efforts of others, the cumulative karmas of the people involved, the place and situation (a matter of luck), etc. Now if we become anxious for results, we will experience anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations. So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give up concern for the results and instead focus solely on doing a good job. The fact is that when we are unconcerned about the results, we are able to focus entirely on our efforts, and the result is even better than before.A humorous acronym for this is NATO or Not Attached to Outcome. Consider its application to a simple everyday activity such as playing golf. When people play golf, they are engrossed in the fruits\u2014whether their score is under par, over par, etc. Now if they could merely focus on playing the shots to the best of their ability, they would find it the most enjoyable game of golf they have ever played. Additionally, with their complete focus on the shot being played, their game would be raised to a higher level.The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. To perform actions is an integral part of human nature. Having come into this world, we all have various duties determined by our family situation, social position, occupation, etc. While performing these actions, we must remember that we are not the enjoyers of the results\u2014the results are meant for the pleasure of God. The individual soul is a tiny part of God (verse 15.7), and hence our inherent nature is to serve him through all our actions.d\u0101sa bh\u016btamida\u1e41 tasya jagatsth\u0101vara jangamam\u015bhr\u012bmann\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a sw\u0101m\u012b jagat\u0101\u1e41prabhur\u012b\u015bhwara\u1e25 (Padma Puran)[v40]\u201cGod is the Master of the entire creation; all moving and non-moving beings are his servants.\u201d Material consciousness is characterized by the following manner of thoughts, \u201cI am the proprietor of all that I possess. It is all meant for my enjoyment. I have the right to enhance my possessions and maximize my enjoyment.\u201d The reverse of this is Spiritual consciousness, which is characterized by thoughts such as, \u201cGod is the owner and enjoyer of this entire world. I am merely his selfless servant. I must use all that I have in the service of God.\u201d Accordingly, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun not to think of himself as the enjoyer of the fruits of his actions.Even while working, give up the pride of doership. Shree Krishna wants Arjun to give up kartritw\u0101bhim\u0101n, or the ego of being the doer. He instructs Arjun never to chase after preconceived motives attached to his actions nor consider himself as the cause of the results of his actions. However, when we perform actions, then why should we not consider ourselves as the doers of those actions? The reason is that our senses, mind, and intellect are inert; God energizes them with his power and puts them at our disposal. As a result, only with the help of the power we receive from him, are we able to work. For example, the tongs in the kitchen are inactive by themselves, but they get energized by someone\u2019s hand, and then they perform even difficult tasks, such as lifting burning coal, etc. Now if we say that the tongs are the doers of actions, it will be inaccurate. If the hand did not energize them, what would they be able to do? They would merely lie inert on the table. Similarly, if God did not supply our body-mind-soul mechanism with the power to perform actions, we could have done nothing. Thus, we must give up the ego of doing, remembering that God is the only source of the power by which we perform all our actions.All the above thoughts are very nicely summarized in the following popular Sanskrit verse:yatk\u1e5bita\u1e41 yatkari\u1e63hy\u0101mi tatsarva\u1e41 na may\u0101 k\u1e5bitamtvay\u0101 k\u1e5bita\u1e41 tu phalabhuk tvameva madhus\u016bdana [v41]\u201cWhatever I have achieved and whatever I wish to achieve, I am not the doer of these. O Madhusudan, you are the real doer, and you alone are the enjoyer of their results.\u201dDo not be attached to inaction. Although the nature of the living being is to work, often situations arise where work seems burdensome and confusing. In such cases, instead of running away from it, we must understand and implement the proper science of work, as explained by Shree Krishna to Arjun. However, it is highly inappropriate if we consider work as laborious and burdensome, and resort to inaction. Becoming attached to inaction is never the solution and is clearly condemned by Shree Krishna."

        "commentary": "The equanimity that enables us to accept all circumstances with serenity is so praiseworthy that Shree Krishna calls it Yog, or union with the Supreme. This equipoise comes from implementing the knowledge of the previous verse. When we understand that the effort is in our hands, not the results, we then concern ourselves only with doing our duty. The results are for the pleasure of God, and so we dedicate them to him. Now, if the results are not to our expectations, we calmly accept them as the will of God. In this way, we are able to accept fame and infamy, success and failure, pleasure and pain, as God\u2019s will, and when we learn to embrace both equally, we develop the equanimity that Shree Krishna talks about.The verse is a very practical solution to the vicissitudes of life. If we are sailing in the ocean in a boat, it is natural to expect the waves of the ocean to shake the boat. If we get disturbed each time a wave rocks the boat, our miseries would be endless. And if we do not expect the waves to arise, we would be expecting the ocean to become something other than its natural self. Waves are an inseparable phenomenon of the ocean. Similarly, as we wade through the ocean of life, it throws up all kinds of waves that are beyond our control. If we keep struggling to eliminate negative situations, we will be unable to avoid unhappiness. But if we can learn to accept everything that comes our way, without sacrificing our best efforts, we will have surrendered to the will of God, and that will be true Yog."

        "commentary": "There are two aspects to work: 1) The external activity we do, 2) Our internal attitude toward it. For example, let us say that a temple is being built in the holy land of Vrindavan. The workers are engaged in a sacred activity, but their attitude is mundane. They are concerned with the salary they receive. If another contractor offers higher wages, they will not mind switching their job. There is also an ascetic living in Vrindavan, who, seeing the glorious temple being built, engages in k\u0101r sev\u0101 (voluntary work) as a service to God. The external work performed by the sadhu and the workers are the same, but the internal attitudes are poles apart.Here Shree Krishna advises Arjun to move higher in his internal motivation toward work. He declares that those who work with the motivation of self-enjoyment are miserly. Those who are detached from the fruits and dedicate their work to a higher cause are superior. And those who offer the fruits to God are truly in knowledge.The word k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a (miserly) has been used here. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam describes a k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a:na veda k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a\u1e25 \u015bhreya \u0101tmano gu\u1e47a-vastu-d\u1e5biktasya t\u0101n ichchhato yachchhed yadi so \u2019pi tath\u0101-vidha\u1e25 (6.9.49)[v42]\u201cK\u1e5bipa\u1e47a are those who think that the ultimate reality consists only of sense objects produced from the material energy.\u201d Again, the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, states: k\u1e5bipa\u1e47o yo \u2019jitendriya\u1e25 (11.19.44)[v43] \u201cA k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a is one who has no control over the senses.\u201dAs an individual evolves to higher levels of consciousness, one naturally sheds the desire for enjoying the fruits of work, and moves in the direction of service. Bill Gates, having renounced his position in Microsoft Corporation, now dedicates his energy in the service of society. Similarly, after having had his fill of power and position as the President of USA, Bill Clinton now preaches the glories of service to humankind, and has even written a book on the topic, \u201cGiving\u2014How Each Of Us Can Change The World.\u201d Their engagement in service is praiseworthy, but it is still imperfectly oriented. That service attitude becomes perfect when we learn to do our works for the pleasure of God, dedicating all the fruits to him."

        "commentary": "Upon hearing the science of karm-yog, people often wonder that if they give up attachment to results, will their performance go down? Shree Krishna explains that working without personal motivation does not reduce the quality of our work; instead we become even more skillful than before. Consider the example of a sincere surgeon who cuts people with his knife while operating upon them. He performs his duty with equanimity, and is undisturbed irrespective of whether the patient survives or dies. This is because he is merely doing his duty unselfishly, to the best of his ability, and is not attached to the results. Hence, even if the patient dies while being operated upon, the surgeon does not feel guilty of murder. However, if the same surgeon\u2019s only child needs to be operated, he does not have the courage to do so. Because of attachment to the results, he fears he will not be able to perform the operation skillfully, and so he seeks the help of another surgeon. This shows that attachment to results does not make us more skillful; rather, the attachment affects our performance adversely. Instead, if we work without attachment, we can do so at our maximum skill level, without feeling nervous, jittery, scared, tense, or excited.Likewise, Arjun\u2019s personal example also illustrates the point that giving up attachment to the fruits does not adversely affect performance. Before hearing the Bhagavad Gita, he intended to engage in war with the desire of winning a kingdom. After hearing the Bhagavad Gita from Shree Krishna, he was fighting because it was his duty to God, and Shree Krishna would be pleased by it. He was still a warrior; however, his internal motivation had changed. The fact that he did his duty without attachment did not make him any less competent than before. In fact, he fought with greater inspiration because his work was directly in service of God."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna continues to expound on the topic of working without attachment to the fruits of actions, and states that it leads one to the state beyond suffering. The paradox of life is that we strive for happiness, but reap misery; we crave love, but we meet with disappointment; we covet life, but know we are moving toward death at every moment. The Bh\u0101gavatam states:sukh\u0101ya karm\u0101\u1e47i karoti loko na tai\u1e25 sukha\u1e41 v\u0101nyad-up\u0101rama\u1e41 v\u0101vindeta bh\u016byas tata eva du\u1e25kha\u1e41 yad atra yukta\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n vaden na\u1e25 (3.5.2)[v44]\u201cEvery human being engages in fruitive works to get happiness, but finds no satisfaction. Instead, these activities only aggravate the misery.\u201d As a result, practically everyone in this world is unhappy. Some suffer from the miseries of their own body and mind; others are tormented by their family members and relatives; some suffer from scarcity of wealth and the paucity of the necessities of life. Materially minded people know they are unhappy, but they think that others ahead of them must be happy, and so they continue running in the direction of material growth. This blind pursuit has been going on for many lifetimes and yet there is no sight of happiness. Now, if people could realize that nobody has ever achieved happiness by engaging in fruitive works, they would then understand that the direction in which they are running is futile, and they would think of doing a U-turn toward spiritual life.Those whose intellects have become steadfast with spiritual knowledge understand that God is the Supreme Enjoyer of everything. Consequently, they renounce attachment to the fruits of their actions, offer everything to him, and serenely accept everything that comes as his pras\u0101d (mercy). In doing so, their actions become free from karmic reactions that bind one to the cycle of life and death."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna had previously said that people who are attached to worldly enjoyment get attracted to the flowery words of the Vedas, which propagate ostentatious rituals for gaining worldly opulences and attaining the celestial abodes (verses 2.42\u20132.43). However, one whose intellect is illumined with spiritual knowledge no longer seeks material sense pleasures, knowing them to be harbingers of misery. Such a person then loses interest in Vedic rituals.

        "commentary": "As s\u0101dhaks advance on the spiritual path, within their minds their relationship with God becomes stronger. At that time, they find the Vedic rituals they were previously performing to be cumbersome and time consuming. They then wonder whether they are obliged to keep performing the rituals, along with their devotion, and if they reject the ritual and dedicate themselves fully to their s\u0101dhan\u0101, will they be committing an offense? Such people will find the answer to their doubt in this verse. Shree Krishna says that to be fixed in s\u0101dhan\u0101 without being allured to the fruitive sections of the Vedas is not an offence; rather, it is a higher spiritual state.Madhavendra Puri, the famous 14th century sage, states this sentiment very emphatically. He was a Vedic Brahmin and used to engage in extensive ritualistic practices, but then took to sany\u0101s (the renounced order), and engaged wholeheartedly in devotion to Shree Krishna. In his later life, he wrote:sandhy\u0101 vandana bhadramastu bhavate bho\u1e25 sn\u0101na tubhya\u1e41 nama\u1e25bho dev\u0101\u1e25 pitara\u015bhchatarapa\u1e47a vidhau naha\u1e41 k\u1e63hama\u1e25 k\u1e63hamyat\u0101myatra kv\u0101pi ni\u1e63hadya y\u0101dava kulottaasya kansadvi\u1e63ha\u1e25sm\u0101ra\u1e41 sm\u0101ramagha\u1e41 har\u0101mi tadala\u1e41 manye kimanyena me [v46]\u201cI wish to apologize to all kinds of rituals as I have no time to respect them.

Now, wherever I sit, I remember the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, the enemy of Kansa, and that is sufficient to release me from material bondage.\u201dShree Krishna uses the word sam\u0101dh\u0101v-achal\u0101 in this verse, to refer to the state of steadfastness in divine consciousness. The word Sam\u0101dhi has been formed from the roots sam (equilibrium) and dhi (intellect), meaning, \u201ca state of total equilibrium of the intellect.\u201d One who is steadfast in the higher consciousness, unmoved by material allurements attains that state of Sam\u0101dhi, or perfect Yog."

        "commentary": "The designations sthita praj\u00f1a (one with steady intellect) and sam\u0101dhi-stha (situated in trance) apply to enlightened persons. Having heard from Shree Krishna about the state of perfect yog, or Sam\u0101dhi, Arjun asks a natural question. He wishes to know the nature of the mind of a person who is in this state. Additionally he wishes to know how this divine state of mind manifests in a person\u2019s behavior.Beginning with this verse, Arjun asks Shree Krishna sixteen sets of questions. In response, Shree Krishna reveals the deepest secrets of karm yog, j\u00f1\u0101na yog, bhakti yog, austerity, meditation, etc. The sixteen sets of questions asked by Arjun are:1. \u201cWhat is the disposition of one who is situated in divine consciousness? (verse 2.54)2. \u201cIf you consider knowledge superior to fruitive works, then why do you ask me to wage this terrible war?\u201d (verse 3.1)3. \u201cWhy is a person impelled to commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force?\u201d (verse 3.36)4. \u201cYou were born much after Vivasvan. How am I to understand that in the beginning you instructed this science to him?\u201d (verse 4.4)5. \u201cYou praised the path of renunciation of actions, and again you praised work with devotion. Please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial?\u201d (verse 5.1)6. \u201cO Krishna, the mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind.\u201d (verse 6.34)7. \u201cWhat is the fate of the unsuccessful yogi who begins the path with faith, but whose mind deviates from God due to untamed passions, and is unable to reach the highest perfection in this life?\u201d (verse 6.37)8. \u201cWhat is Brahman and what is karma? What is Adhibh\u016bta, and who are the \u0100dhidaiva? Who is \u0100dhiyaj\u00f1a and how does he dwell in this body? O slayer of the Madhu demon, how can those of steadfast mind be united with you at the time of death?\u201d (verse 8.1-2)9. \u201cPlease describe to me your divine opulences, by which you pervade all the worlds.\u201d (verse 10.16)10. \u201cI long to see your cosmic form, O Supreme divine Personality.\u201d (verse 11.3)11. \u201cYou, who existed before all creation, I wish to know who you are, for your nature and workings mystify me.\u201d (verse 11.31)12. \u201cBetween those who are steadfastly devoted to your personal form and those who worship the formless Brahman, whom do you consider to be more perfect in Yog?\u201d (verse 12.1)13. \u201cI wish to know about Prak\u1e5biti (Nature) and Puru\u015bh (the enjoyer). What is the field of activities, and who is the knower of the field? What is the nature of knowledge, and the object of knowledge?\u201d (verse 13.1)14. \u201cWhat are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three gu\u1e47as, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the bondage of the gu\u1e47as?\u201d (verse 14.21)15. \u201cWhere do they stand who disregard the injunctions of the scriptures, but still worship with faith?\u201d (verse 17.1)16. \u201cI wish to understand the nature of sany\u0101s (renunciation), and how it is distinct from ty\u0101g, or renouncing the fruits of actions.\u201d (verse 18.1)"

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna begins answering Arjun\u2019s questions here, and continues till the end of the chapter. Each fragment is naturally drawn towards its whole; just as a piece of stone is drawn by the force of gravitation towards the earth. The individual soul is a fragment of God, who is infinite bliss. Hence, the soul is a fragment of the ocean of infinite bliss, and it experiences the natural urge for bliss. When it strives to relish the bliss of the soul from God, it is called \u201cDivine Love.\u201d But when, in ignorance of its spiritual nature, it thinks of itself as the body, and seeks to relish the bliss of the body from the world, it is called \u201clust.\u201dThis world has been called m\u1e5biga t\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47\u0101 in the scriptures, meaning \u201clike the mirage seen by the deer.\u201d The sun rays reflecting on the hot desert sand create an illusion of water for the deer. It thinks there is water ahead of it and runs to quench its thirst. But the more it runs toward the water, the more the mirage fades away. Its dull intellect cannot recognize that it is running after an illusion. The unfortunate deer keeps chasing the illusory water and dies of exhaustion on the desert sand. Similarly, the material energy Maya too creates an illusion of happiness, and we run after that illusory happiness in the hope of quenching the thirst of our senses. But no matter how much we try, happiness keeps fading further away from us. The Garu\u1e0d Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:chakradharo \u2019pi suratva\u1e41 suratval\u0101bhe sakalasurapatitvambhavtirum surapatir\u016brdhvagatitva\u1e41 tath\u0101pi nanivartate t\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47\u0101 (2.12.14) [v47]\u201cA king wishes to be the emperor of the whole world; the emperor aspires to be a celestial god; a celestial god seeks to be Indra, the king of heaven; and Indra desires to be Brahma, the secondary creator. Yet the thirst for material enjoyment does not get satiated.\u201dBut when one learns to turn the mind away from material allurements and renounces the desires of the senses, such a person comes in touch with the inner bliss of the soul and becomes transcendentally situated. The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had goes to the extent of saying that one who has renounced desires becomes like God:yad\u0101 sarve pramuchyante k\u0101m\u0101 ye \u2019sya h\u1e5bidi \u015bhrita\u1e25atha martyo \u2019m\u1e5bito bhavatyatra brahma sama\u015bhnute (2.3.14)[v48]\u201cWhen one eliminates all selfish desires from the heart, then the materially fettered j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 (soul) attains freedom from birth and death, and becomes Godlike in virtue.\u201d Shree Krishna states in the above verse that a transcendentally situated person is one who has given up selfish desires and cravings of the senses, and is satisfied in the self."

        "commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna describes sages of steady wisdom as: 1) V\u012bta r\u0101ga\u2014they give up craving for pleasure, 2) V\u012bta bhaya\u2014they remain free from fear, 3) V\u012bta krodha\u2014they are devoid of anger.An enlightened person does not allow the mind to harbor the material frailties of lust, anger, greed, envy, etc. Only then can the mind steadily contemplate on transcendence and be fixed in the divine. If one permits the mind to brood over miseries, then the contemplation on the divine ceases and the mind is dragged down from the transcendental level. The process of torture works in the same manner. More than the present pain itself, it is the memories of past pain and apprehensions of future pain that torment the mind. But when the mind drops these two and has to simply grope with the present sensation, the pain surprisingly shrinks to a manageable (within the limits of tolerance) size. It is well known that historically Buddhist monks adopted a similar technique for tolerating torture from invading conquerors.Similarly, if the mind craves external pleasures, it runs to the objects of enjoyment, and is again diverted from divine contemplation. So a sage of steady wisdom is one who does not allow the mind to hanker for pleasure or lament for miseries. Further, such a sage does not permit the mind to succumb to the urges of fear and anger. In this way, the mind becomes situated on the transcendental level."

One may wonder how an English poet expressed the same state of enlightenment that is described by the Supreme Lord. The fact is that the urge for enlightenment is the intrinsic nature of the soul. Hence, knowingly or unknowingly, everyone craves for it, in all cultures around the world. Shree Krishna is describing it here, in response to Arjun\u2019s question."

        "commentary": "Attempting to quench the cravings of the senses by supplying them with their desired objects is like trying to dowse a fire by pouring clarified butter on it. The fire may be smothered for a moment, but then it flares up with redoubled intensity. Hence, the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states that desires never go away when they are fulfilled; they only come back more strongly:na j\u0101tu k\u0101ma\u1e25 k\u0101m\u0101n\u0101m upabhogena \u015bh\u0101myatihavi\u1e63h\u0101 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a-vartmeva bh\u016bya ev\u0101bhivardhate (9.19.14) [v49]\u201cFulfilling the desires of the senses does not extinguish them, just as offering oblations of butter in the fire does not extinguish it; instead, it makes the fire blaze even stronger.\u201dThese desires can be compared to an itch in the body. The itch is troublesome and creates an irresistible urge to scratch. But scratching does not solve the problem. For a few moments, there is relief, and then the itch returns with greater force. Instead, if someone can tolerate the itch for some time, it begins losing its sting, and dies down slowly. That is the secret for getting peace from the itch. The same logic applies to desires as well. The mind and senses throw up myriad desires for happiness, but as long as we are in the game of fulfilling them, happiness remains illusory, like the mirage. But when we learn to discard all these desires, to find happiness in God, the mind and senses make peace with us.So an enlightened sage intelligently masters the senses and the mind. The illustration used in this verse is that of the turtle. Whenever it encounters danger, the turtle protects itself by drawing its limbs and head inside its shell. After the danger passes, the turtle again extracts its limbs and head and continues on its way. The enlightened soul possesses similar control over the mind and senses and can retract and extract them according to the needs of the situation."

        "commentary": "When one gives up eating, as in a fast, the desires of the senses become feeble. Similarly, in sickness one loses interest toward the objects of enjoyment. These states of dispassion are temporary, for the seed of desire remains within the mind. Again when the fast is terminated or the sickness goes away, the desires return.What is this seed of desire? It is the intrinsic nature of the soul for the divine bliss of God, of whom it is a tiny fragment. Until it gets that divine bliss, the soul can never be contented, and the search for happiness will continue. S\u0101dhaks (spiritual aspirants) may forcibly restrain their senses with their will power, but such restrain is temporary because it does not extinguish the internal flame of desire. However, when the soul engages in devotion toward God, and gets divine bliss, it experiences the higher taste for which it had been craving since infinite lifetimes. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had states:raso vai sa\u1e25 rasa\u1e41 hyev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 \u2019nand\u012b bhavati  (2.7.2)[v50]\u201cGod is all-bliss. When the soul attains God, it becomes satiated in bliss.\u201d Then, one naturally develops dispassion toward the lower sensual pleasures. This detachment that comes through devotion is firm and unshakeable.Thus, the Bhagavad Gita does not teach a dry suppression of desires, instead it teaches the beautiful path of sublimation of desires by directing them toward God. The Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa expressed this principle very eloquently, when he said: \u201cDevotion is love for the highest; and the lowest shall fall away by itself.\u201d"

        "commentary": "The senses are like wild horses that have been newly harnessed. They are impetuous and reckless, and hence, disciplining them is an important battle that s\u0101dhaks have to fight within themselves. Therefore, those desirous of spiritual growth should carefully strive to tame the indulgent senses, which are colored with lust and greed, or else they have the power to sabotage and derail the spiritual process of even the most well-intentioned yogis.The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam relates a story that perfectly illustrates this statement (canto 9, chapter 6). There was a great sage in ancient times, known as Saubhari. He is mentioned in the Rig Veda, where there is a mantra called Saubhari Sutra. There is also a scripture called the Saubhari Samhita. So he was not just an ordinary sage. Saubhari had attained such control over his body that he used to submerge himself in the river Yamuna and meditate under water. One day, he saw two fish mating. This sight carried away his mind and senses, and the desire for sexual association arose in him. He abandoned his spiritual practice and came out of the water, wondering how to fulfill his desire.At that time, the king of Ayodhya was Mandhata, who was a very illustrious and noble ruler. He had fifty daughters, each more beautiful than the other. Saubhari approached the king and asked for the hand of one of the fifty princesses.King Mandhata wondered about the sanity of the sage and thought to himself, \u201cAn old man wanting to get married!\u201d The king knew Saubhari to be a powerful sage, and feared that if he refused, the sage might curse him. But if he consented, the life of one of his daughters would be ruined. He was in a dilemma. So he said, \u201cO holy one! I have no objection to your request. Please take a seat. I shall bring my fifty daughters before you, and whosoever chooses you will become yours in marriage.\u201d The king was confident that none of his daughters would choose the old ascetic, and in this way, he would be saved from the sage\u2019s curse.Saubhari was all too aware of the king\u2019s intention. He told the king that he would return the following day. That evening, he used his yogic powers to turn himself into a handsome young man. Consequently, when he presented himself at the palace the next day, all the fifty princesses chose him as their husband. The king was bound by the word he had given and was compelled to marry all his daughters to the sage.Now the king was concerned about the fights that would take place amongst the fifty sisters, since they would have to share a husband. However, Saubhari again used his yogic powers. Putting the king\u2019s apprehension to rest, he assumed fifty forms and created fifty palaces for his wives, and lived separately with each one of them. In this manner, thousands of years passed by. The Puranas state that Saubhari had many children from each of them, and those children had further children, until a tiny city had been created. One day, Saubhari came to his senses, and exclaimed, aho ima\u1e41 pa\u015bhyata me vin\u0101\u015bha\u1e41 (Bh\u0101gavatam 9.6.50) [v51] \u201cO humans! Those of you, who make plans to attain happiness through material acquisitions, be careful. Look at my degradation\u2014where I was and where am I now. I created fifty bodies by my yogic powers, and lived with fifty women for thousands of years. And yet, the senses did not experience fulfillment; they only kept hankering for more. Learn from my downfall and be warned not to venture in this direction.\u201d"

And since we do not recognize lust, anger, greed, etc. as mental diseases, we do not try to cure them. Psychology is a branch of human knowledge that attempts to analyze these ailments and propose solutions to them. However, both the analysis and the solution presented by western psychology leave much to be desired, and appear to be gross approximations of the reality of the mind.In this and the subsequent verse, Shree Krishna has given perfect and penetrating insight into functioning of the mind. He explains that when we repeatedly contemplate that there is happiness in some object, the mind becomes attached to it. For example, in a class there are a number of boys and girls, and they interact innocuously with each other. One day one boy notices something about one girl and starts thinking, \u201cI would be very happy if she were mine.\u201d As he continuously repeats this thought in his mind, his mind becomes attached to her. He tells his friends that he is madly in love with her, and he is unable to study because his mind repeatedly goes to her. His friends ridicule him that they all interact with her in class, but none of them is crazy about her. Why is he losing his sleep and ruining his studies because of her? The fact is that he repeatedly thought that there was happiness in the girl, and so his mind became attached to her.Now attachment seems quite innocuous by itself. But the problem is that from attachment comes desire. If one is attached to drinks, the desire for drinks comes repeatedly to the mind. If one is attached to cigarettes, then thoughts of the pleasure of smoking cigarettes repeatedly flow in the mind, creating a craving for them. In this way, attachment leads to desire.Once desire develops, it gives birth to two more problems\u2014greed and anger. Greed comes from the fulfillment of desire. Jimi pratil\u0101bha lobha adhik\u0101\u012b (Ramayan) [v54] \u201cIf you satisfy desire, it leads to greed.\u201d Thus desire is never eliminated by satiating it:yat p\u1e5bithivy\u0101\u1e41 vr\u012bhi-yava\u1e41 hira\u1e47ya\u1e41 pa\u015bhava\u1e25 striya\u1e25na duhyanti mana\u1e25-pr\u012bti\u1e41 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u0101ma-hatasya te (Bh\u0101gavatam 9.19.13) [v55]\u201cIf one person were to get all the wealth, luxuries, and sensual objects in the world, that person\u2019s desire would still not be satiated. Hence, knowing it to be the cause of misery, an intelligent person should renounce desire.\u201dOn the flip side what happens if the fulfillment of desire is obstructed? It gives rise to anger. Bear in mind that anger does not arise by itself. It is created from the obstruction of desire; and desire arises from attachment, while attachment comes from contemplation of the sense objects. In this manner, we see how the simple act of contemplating the pleasures of sense objects leads downward to the twin diseases of greed and anger. In the next verse Shree Krishna continues the chain further down, and explains the consequences of anger."

        "commentary": "Anger impairs judgment, just as the morning mist creates a hazy covering on the sunlight. In anger, people commit mistakes that they later regret, because the intellect gets clouded by the haze of emotions. People say, \u201cHe is twenty years elder to me. Why did I speak in this manner to him? What happened to me?\u201d What happened was that the faculty of judgment was affected by anger, and hence the mistake of scolding an elder was made.When the intellect is clouded, it leads to bewilderment of memory. The person then forgets what is right and what is wrong, and flows along with the surge of emotions. The downward descent continues from there, and bewilderment of memory results in destruction of the intellect. And since the intellect is the internal guide, when it gets destroyed, one is ruined. In this manner, the path of descent from divinity to impiety has been described beginning with contemplation on the sense objects to the destruction of the intellect."

        "commentary": "The entire downward spiral leading to ruin begins with contemplating happiness in sense objects. Now, the urge for happiness is as natural to the soul as thirst is to the physical body. It is impossible to think \u201cI will not contemplate happiness anywhere,\u201d because it is unnatural for the soul. The simple solution then is to envision happiness in the proper direction, i.e. in God. If we can repeatedly revise the thought that happiness is in God, we will develop attachment toward him. This divine attachment will not degrade the mind like material attachment; rather, it will purify it. God is all-pure, and when we attach our mind to him, the mind will also become pure.Thus, whenever Shree Krishna asks us to give up attachment and desire, he is referring only to material attachment and desire. Spiritual attachment and desire are not to be given up; in fact, they are most praiseworthy. They are to be cultivated and increased for purification of the mind. The greater the burning desire we develop for God, the purer our mind will become. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who propound the worship of the undifferentiated attributeless Brahman do not understand this point when they recommend giving up all attachments. However, Shree Krishna states: \u201cThose who attach their minds to me with unadulterated devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and attain the level of the supreme Brahman.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 14.26) He repeatedly urges Arjun to attach his mind to God in many verses ahead, such as 8.7, 8.14, 9.22, 9.34, 10.10, 12.8, 11.54, 18.55, 18.58, 18.65, etc.Attachment and aversion are two sides of the same coin. Aversion is nothing but negative attachment. Just as, in attachment, the object of attachment repeatedly comes to one\u2019s mind; similarly, in aversion, the object of hatred keeps popping into the mind. So attachment and aversion to material objects both have the same effect on the mind\u2014they dirty it and pull it into the three modes of material nature. When the mind is free from both attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in devotion to God, one receives the grace of God and experiences his unlimited divine bliss. On experiencing that higher taste, the mind no longer feels attracted to the sense objects, even while using them. Thus, even while tasting, touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing, like all of us, the sthita praj\u00f1a is free from both attachment and aversion."

        "commentary": "Grace is like a divine energy that floods into a person\u2019s personality. By grace, God who is sat-chit-\u0101nand bestows his divine knowledge, divine love, and divine bliss. This entrenches the intellect, like the North Star, in the love, bliss, and knowledge of God. By God\u2019s grace, when we experience the higher taste of divine bliss, the agitation for sensual happiness is extinguished. Once that hankering for material objects ceases, one goes beyond all suffering and the mind becomes tranquil. In that state of internal fulfillment, the intellect becomes firm in its decision that God alone is the source of happiness and is the final goal of the soul. Previously, the intellect was accepting this only on the basis of knowledge as stated in the scriptures, but now it gets the experience of perfect peace and divine bliss. This convinces the intellect beyond any shadow of doubt, and it becomes steadily situated in God."

Previously, Shree Krishna said \u201cKnow God; know peace.\u201d In this verse, he says \u201cNo God; no peace.\u201d A person who has not learnt to discipline the mind and senses can neither meditate upon God nor experience his divine bliss. Without the higher taste, it becomes impossible to renounce the lower taste, and such a person keeps hankering for material happiness, like the bee finds it impossible to renounce the nectar of the flower:r\u0101trirgami\u1e63hyati bhavi\u1e63hyati suprabh\u0101ta\u1e41bh\u0101sv\u0101nudve\u1e63hyati hasi\u1e63hyati pa\u1e45kaja\u015bhr\u012b\u1e25eva\u1e41 vichintayati ko\u1e63ha gate dvirepheh\u0101 hanta hanta nalin\u012b\u1e41 gaja ujjah\u0101ra (Sukti Sudhakar) ][v56]This popular verse in Sanskrit literature relates a bee\u2019s story. The bee was sitting on a lotus flower, drinking its nectar. As the sun began setting, the petals of the flower began shutting. But the bee was so attached to enjoying the object of its senses that it refused to fly off. It thought, \u201cThere is still time for the flower to close. Let me suck some more nectar while I can.\u201d In the same way, we can see old age coming as a sure sign of death, but like the bee, we remain engrossed in enjoying worldly pleasures.In the meantime, it became dark and the lotus flower closed, trapping the bee. It thought, \u201cNever mind! Let me remain inside my beloved flower for tonight. Tomorrow morning, when its petals open again, I will fly away.\u201d K\u0101\u1e63h\u1e6dha bhedo nipu\u1e47opi sang\u1e5bih\u012b ku\u1e47\u1e6dhito bhavati padma vibhede [v57] \u201cA bee has the power to cut through wood. But look at the attachment to the sense objects that the bee which can cut through wood is stuck inside the soft petals of the lotus.\u201d In the meantime, an elephant came, broke the lotus from the stem, and swallowed it. The bee along with the lotus went into the stomach of the elephant. The bee was thinking, \u201cMy beloved lotus is going somewhere, and I am happily going along with it.\u201d It died shortly thereafter.Similarly, we humans too remain engrossed in the gratification of the senses, and do not heed to the message of the Saints to engage in devotion to God. Finally, time overtakes us in the form of death. Here, Shree Krishna says that those who refuse to discipline the senses and engage in devotion continue to be rocked by the three-fold miseries of Maya. Material desires are like an itching eczema, and the more we indulge in them, the worse they become. How can we be truly happy in this state of material indulgence?"

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna has used day and night figuratively here. People often confuse the meaning of this verse by taking the words literally. There was once a Khade Shree Baba (the standing ascetic), whose disciples claimed he was a very big sage. He had not slept in thirty-five years. He would stand in his room, resting on a hanging rope under his armpits. He used the rope to help him remain in the standing position. On being asked what his motivation was for this destructive kind of austerity, he would quote this verse of the Bhagavad Gita: \u201cWhat all beings see as night, the enlightened sage sees as day.\u201d So to practice it, he had given up sleeping at night. What a misunderstanding of the verse! From all that standing, his feet and lower legs were swollen, and so he could practically do nothing except stand.Let us try and understand the true meaning of Shree Krishna\u2019s words. Those who are in mundane consciousness look to material enjoyment as the real purpose of life. They consider the opportunity for worldly pleasures as the success of life, or \u201cday,\u201d and deprivation from sense pleasures as darkness, or \u201cnight.\u201d On the other hand, those who have become wise with divine knowledge, see sense enjoyment as harmful for the soul, and hence view it as \u201cnight.\u201d They consider refraining from the objects of the senses as elevating to the soul, and hence look on it as \u201cday.\u201d Using those connotations of the words, Shree Krishna states that what is night for the sage is day for the worldly-minded people, and vice versa."

The moment we harbor a desire, we walk into the trap of greed and anger. Either way, we get trapped. So the path to inner peace does not lie in fulfilling desires, but instead in eliminating them.Greed. Firstly, greed for material advancement is a great waste of time. Secondly, it is an endless chase. In developed countries, very few people are deprived of enough to eat and wear, and yet they remain disturbed; this is because their hankering is still unsatisfied. Thus, those who possess the wealth of contentment possess one of the biggest treasures of life.Ego. Most of the quarrels that erupt between people stem from the ego. Mark H McCormack, author of What They Don\u2019t Teach You At Harvard Business School writes: \u201cMost corporate executives are one giant ego, with a couple of arms and legs sticking out.\u201d Statistics reveal that a majority of executives, who lose their jobs in the senior management level, do so not because of professional incompetence, but because of interpersonal issues. The way to peace is not to nurture and increase pride, but to get rid of it.Proprietorship. The feeling of proprietorship is based upon ignorance because the whole world belongs to God. We came empty-handed in the world, and we will go back empty-handed. How then can we think of worldly things as ours?"

When the soul purifies the heart (the mind and intellect are sometimes jointly referred to as the heart), God bestows his divine grace, as mentioned in verse 2.64. By his grace, he grants divine knowledge, divine bliss, and divine love to the soul. All these are divine energies that are given by God to the soul at the time of God-realization.At the same time, he liberates the soul from the bondage of Maya. The sa\u00f1chit karmas (account of karmas of endless lifetimes) are destroyed. The avidy\u0101, ignorance within, from endless lifetimes in the material world, is dispelled. The influence of tri-gu\u1e47as, three modes of material nature, ceases. The tri-do\u1e63has, three defects of the materially conditioned state come to an end. The pa\u00f1ch-kle\u015bhas, five defects of the material intellect, are destroyed. The pa\u00f1ch-ko\u015bhas, five sheaths of the material energy, are burnt. And from that point onward, the soul becomes free from the bondage of Maya for the rest of eternity.When this state of God-realization is achieved, the soul is said to be j\u012bvan mukt, or liberated even while residing in the body. Then, at the time of death, the liberated soul finally discards the corporeal body, and it reaches the Supreme Abode of God. The Rig Veda states:tadvi\u1e63h\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015bhyanti s\u016braya\u1e25 (1.22.20) [v60]\u201cOnce the soul attains God, it always remains in union with him. After that, the ignorance of Maya can never overpower it again.\u201d That state of eternal liberation from Maya is also called nirv\u0101\u1e47, mok\u1e63ha, etc. As a result, liberation is a natural consequence of God-realization."

The first is the acquisition of knowledge through the analytical study of the nature of the soul and its distinction from the body. Shree Krishna refers to this as s\u0101nkhya yog. People with a philosophic bend of mind are inclined toward this path of knowing the self through intellectual analysis. The second is the process of working in the spirit of devotion to God, or karm yog. Shree Krishna also calls this buddhi yog\u00b8 as explained in the previous verse. Working in this manner purifies the mind, and knowledge naturally awakens in the purified mind, thus leading to enlightenment.Amongst people interested in the spiritual path, there are those who are inclined toward contemplation and then there are those inclined to action. Hence, both these paths have existed ever since the soul\u2019s aspiration for God-realization has existed.

The mind continues to engage in fruitive thoughts, and since mental work is also a form of karma, it binds one in karmic reactions, just as physical work does. A true karm yogi must learn to work without any attachment to the fruits of actions. This requires cultivation of knowledge in the intellect. Hence, philosophic knowledge is also necessary for success in karm yog.In the second line, Shree Krishna declares that the s\u0101nkhya yogi cannot attain the state of knowledge merely by renouncing the world and becoming a monk. One may give up the physical objects of the senses, but true knowledge cannot awaken as long as the mind remains impure. The mind has a tendency to repeat its previous thoughts. Such repetition creates a channel within the mind, and new thoughts flow irresistibly in the same direction. Out of previous habit, the materially contaminated mind keeps running in the direction of anxiety, stress, fear, hatred, envy, attachment, and the whole gamut of material emotions. Thus, realized knowledge will not appear in an impure heart by mere physical renunciation. It must be accompanied by congruent action that purifies the mind and intellect. Therefore, action is also necessary for success in s\u0101nkhya yog.It is said that devotion without philosophy is sentimentality, and philosophy without devotion is intellectual speculation. Action and knowledge are necessary in both karm yog and s\u0101nkhya yog. It is only their proportion that varies, creating the difference between the two paths."

So when they renounce their profession, they think they are not performing actions. But Shree Krishna considers all activities performed with the body, mind, and tongue as actions. Hence, he tells Arjun that complete inactivity is impossible even for a moment. If we simply sit down, it is an activity; if we lie down, that is also an activity; if we fall asleep, the mind is still engaged in dreaming; even in deep sleep, the heart and other bodily organs are functioning. Thus Shree Krishna declares that for human beings inactivity is an impossible state to reach, since the body-mind-intellect mechanism is compelled by its own make-up of the three gu\u1e47as (sattva, rajas, and tamas) to perform work in the world. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam contains a similar verse:na hi ka\u015bhchit k\u1e63ha\u1e47am api j\u0101tu ti\u1e63h\u1e6dhaty akarma-k\u1e5bitk\u0101ryate hy ava\u015bha\u1e25 karma gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 sv\u0101bh\u0101vikair bal\u0101t (6.1.53)[v1]\u201cNobody can remain inactive for even a moment.

This creates a situation of hypocrisy where one displays an external show of religiosity while internally living a life of ignoble sentiments and base motives. Hence, it is better to face the struggles of the world as a karm yogi, than to lead the life of a false ascetic. Running away from the problems of life by prematurely taking sany\u0101s is not the way forward in the journey of the evolution of the soul.

You have grown long locks of hair and smeared ash on your body (as a sign of detachment). But without the internal devotion, the external beard you have sprouted only makes you resemble a goat.\u201d Shree Krishna states in this verse that people who externally renounce the objects of the senses while continuing to dwell upon them in the mind are hypocrites, and they delude themselves.The Puranas relate the story of two brothers, Tavrit and Suvrit, to illustrate this point. The brothers were walking from their house to hear the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam discourse at the temple. On the way, it began raining heavily, so they ran into the nearest building for shelter. To their dismay, they found themselves in a brothel, where women of disrepute were dancing to entertain their guests. Tavrit, the elder brother, was appalled and walked out into the rain, to continue to the temple. The younger brother, Suvrit, felt no harm in sitting there for a while to escape getting wet in the rain.Tavrit reached the temple and sat for the discourse, but in his mind he became remorseful, \u201cO how boring this is! I made a dreadful mistake; I should have remained at the brothel. My brother must be enjoying himself greatly in revelry there.\u201d Suvrit, on the other hand, started thinking, \u201cWhy did I remain in this house of sin? My brother is so holy; he is bathing his intellect in the knowledge of the Bh\u0101gavatam. I too should have braved the rain and reached there. After all, I am not made of salt that I would have melted in a little bit of rain.\u201dWhen the rain stopped, both started out in the direction of the other. The moment they met, lightning struck them and they both died on the spot. The Yamdoots (servants of the god of Death) came to take Tavrit to hell. Tavrit complained, \u201cI think you have made a mistake. I am Tavrit. It was my brother who was sitting at the brothel a little while ago. You should be taking him to hell.\u201d The Yamdoots replied, \u201cWe have made no mistake. He was sitting there to avoid the rain, but in his mind he was longing to be at the Bh\u0101gavatam discourse. On the other hand, while you were sitting and hearing the discourse, your mind was yearning to be at the brothel.\u201d Tavrit was doing exactly what Shree Krishna declares in this verse; he had externally renounced the objects of the senses, but was dwelling upon them in the mind. This was the improper kind of renunciation. The next verse states the proper kind of renunciation."

        "commentary": "The word karm yog has been used in this verse. It consists of two main concepts: karm (occupational duties) and Yog (union with God). Hence, a karm yogi is one who performs worldly duties while keeping the mind attached to God. Such a karm yogi is not bound by karma even while performing all kinds of works. This is because what binds one to the law of karma is not actions, but the attachment to the fruits of those actions. And a karm yogi has no attachment to the fruits of action. On the other hand, a false renunciant renounces action, but does not forsake attachment, and thus remains bound in the law of karma.Shree Krishna says here that a person in household life who practices karm yog is superior to the false renunciant who continues to dwell on the objects of the senses in the mind. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj contrasts these two situations very beautifully:mana hari me\u1e45 tana jagat me\u1e45, karmayog tehi j\u0101natana hari me\u1e45 mana jagat me\u1e45, yaha mah\u0101na aj\u00f1\u0101na(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 84)\u00a0[v3]\u201cWhen one works in the world with the body, but keeps the mind attached to God, know it to be karm yog. When one engages in spirituality with the body, but keeps the mind attached to the world, know it to be hypocrisy.\u201d"

Hence, the Vedas prescribe duties for humans, to help them discipline their mind and senses. In fact, laziness is described as one of the biggest pitfalls on the spiritual path:\u0101lasya hi manu\u1e63hy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 \u015bhar\u012brastho mah\u0101n ripu\u1e25n\u0101styudyamasamo bandh\u016b\u1e25 k\u1e5bitv\u0101 ya\u1e41 n\u0101vas\u012bdati [v4]\u201cLaziness is the greatest enemy of humans, and is especially pernicious since it resides in their own body. Work is their most trustworthy friend, and is a guarantee against downfall.\u201d Even the basic bodily activities like eating, bathing, and maintaining proper health require work. These obligatory actions are called nitya karm. To neglect these basic maintenance activities is not a sign of progress, but an indication of slothfulness, leading to emaciation and weakness of both body and mind. On the other hand, a cared for and nourished body is a positive adjunct on the road to spirituality. Thus, the state of inertia does not lend itself either to material or spiritual achievement. For the progress of our own soul, we should embrace the duties that help elevate and purify our mind and intellect."

        "commentary": "A knife in the hands of a robber is a weapon for intimidation or committing murder, but in the hands of a surgeon is an invaluable instrument used for saving people\u2019s lives. The knife in itself is neither murderous nor benedictory\u2014its effect is determined by how it is used. As Shakespeare said: \u201cFor there is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\u201d Similarly, work in itself is neither good nor bad. Depending upon the state of the mind, it can be either binding or elevating. Work done for the enjoyment of one\u2019s senses and the gratification of one\u2019s pride is the cause of bondage in the material world, while work performed as yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice) for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord liberates one from the bonds of Maya and attracts divine grace. Since it is our nature to perform actions, we are forced to work in one of the two modes. We cannot remain without working for even a moment as our mind cannot remain still.If we do not perform actions as a sacrifice to God, we will be forced to work to gratify our mind and senses. Instead, when we perform work as a sacrifice, we then look upon the whole world and everything in it as belonging to God, and therefore, meant for utilization in his service. A beautiful ideal for this was established by King Raghu, the ancestor of Lord Ram. Raghu performed the Vi\u015bhwajit sacrifice, which requires donating all of one\u2019s possessions in charity.sa vi\u015bhwajitam \u0101jahre yaj\u00f1a\u1e41 sarvasva dak\u1e63hi\u1e47am\u0101d\u0101na\u1e41 hi visarg\u0101ya sat\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101rimuch\u0101m iva (Raghuvan\u015bh 4.86)[v5]\u201cRaghu performed the Vi\u015bhwajit yaj\u00f1a with the thought that just as clouds gather water from the Earth, not for their enjoyment, but to shower it back upon the Earth, similarly, all he possessed as a king had been gathered from the public in taxes, not for his pleasure, but for the pleasure of God. So he decided to use his wealth to please God by serving his citizens with it.\u201d After the yaj\u00f1a, Raghu donated all his possessions to his citizens. Then, donning the rags of a beggar and holding an earthen pot, he went out to beg for his meal.While resting under a tree, he heard a group of people discussing, \u201cOur king is so benevolent. He has given away everything in charity.\u201d Raghu was pained on hearing his praise and spoke out, \u201cWhat are you discussing?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe are praising our king. There is nobody in the world as charitable as him.\u201d Raghu retorted, \u201cDo not ever say that again. Raghu has given nothing.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat kind of person are you who are criticizing our king? Everyone knows that Raghu has donated everything he owned.\u201d Raghu replied, \u201cGo and ask your king that when he came into this world did he possess anything? He was born empty-handed, is it not? Then what was his that he has given away?\u201dThis is the spirit of karm yog, in which we see the whole world as belonging to God, and hence meant for the satisfaction of God. We then perform our duties not for gratifying our mind and senses, but for the pleasure of God. Lord Vishnu instructed the Prachetas in this fashion:g\u1e5bihe\u1e63hv \u0101vi\u015bhat\u0101\u1e41 ch\u0101pi pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 ku\u015bhala-karma\u1e47\u0101mmad-v\u0101rt\u0101-y\u0101ta-y\u0101m\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 na bandh\u0101ya g\u1e5bih\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25 (Bh\u0101gavatam 4.30.19)[v6]\u201cThe perfect karm yogis, even while fulfilling their household duties, perform all their works as yaj\u00f1a to me, knowing me to be the Enjoyer of all activities. They spend whatever free time they have in hearing and chanting my glories. Such people, though living in the world, never get bound by their actions.\u201d"

        "commentary": "All the elements of nature are integral parts of the system of God\u2019s creation. All the parts of the system naturally draw from and give back to the whole. The sun lends stability to the earth and provides heat and light necessary for life to exist. Earth creates food from its soil for our nourishment and also holds essential minerals in its womb for a civilized lifestyle. The air moves the life force in our body and enables transmission of sound energy. We humans too are an integral part of the entire system of God\u2019s creation. The air that we breathe, the Earth that we walk upon, the water that we drink, and the light that illumines our day, are all gifts of creation to us. While we partake of these gifts to sustain our lives, we also have our duties toward the integral system. Shree Krishna says that we are obligated to participate with the creative force of nature by performing our prescribed duties in the service of God. That is the yaj\u00f1a he expects from us.Consider the example of a hand. It is an integral part of the body. It receives its nourishment\u2014blood, oxygen, nutrients, etc.\u2014from the body, and in turn, it performs necessary functions for the body. If the hand looks on this service as burdensome, and decides to get severed from the body, it cannot sustain itself for even a few minutes. It is in the performance of its yaj\u00f1a toward the body that the self-interest of the hand is also fulfilled. Similarly, we individual souls are tiny parts of the Supreme Soul and we all have our role to play in the grand scheme of things. When we perform our yaj\u00f1a toward him, our self-interest is naturally satiated.Generally, the term yaj\u00f1a refers to fire sacrifice. In the Bhagavad Gita, yaj\u00f1a includes all the prescribed actions laid down in the scriptures, when they are done as an offering to the Supreme."

        "commentary": "The celestial gods, or devat\u0101s, are in-charge of the administration of the universe. The Supreme Lord does his work of managing the universe through them. These devat\u0101s live within this material universe, in the higher planes of existence, called swarg, or the celestial abodes. The devat\u0101s are not God; they are souls like us. They occupy specific posts in the affairs of running the world. Consider the Federal government of a country. There is a Secretary of State, a Secretary of the Treasury, a Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, and so on. These are posts, and chosen people occupy those posts for a limited tenure. At the end of the tenure, the government changes and all the post-holders change too. Similarly, in administering the affairs of the world, there are posts such as Agni Dev (the god of fire), V\u0101yu Dev (the god of the wind), Varu\u1e47a Dev (the god of the ocean), Indra Dev (the king of the celestial gods), etc. Souls selected by virtue of their deeds in past lives occupy these seats for a fixed number of ages, and administer the affairs of the universe. These are the devat\u0101s (celestial gods).The Vedas mention various ceremonies and processes for the satisfaction of the celestial gods, and in turn these devat\u0101s bestow material prosperity. However, when we perform our yaj\u00f1a for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, the celestial gods are automatically appeased, just as when we water the root of a tree, the water inevitably reaches its flowers, fruits, leaves, branches, and twigs. The Skandh Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:archite deva deve\u015bhe \u015bha\u1e45kha chakra gad\u0101dharearchit\u0101\u1e25 sarve dev\u0101\u1e25 syur yata\u1e25 sarva gato hari\u1e25\u00a0[v7]\u201cBy worshipping the Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu, we automatically worship all the celestial gods, since they all derive their power from him.\u201d Thus, the performance of yaj\u00f1a is naturally pleasing to the devat\u0101s, who then create prosperity for living beings by favorably adjusting the elements of material nature."

The devat\u0101s perform their duty, and expect us to perform our duty in the proper consciousness too. Since these celestial gods are all servants of the Supreme Lord, they become pleased when someone performs a sacrifice for him, and in turn assist such a soul by creating favorable material conditions. Thus, it is said that when we strongly resolve to serve God, the universe begins to cooperate with us.However, if we begin looking upon the gifts of nature, not as means of serving the Lord but as objects of our own enjoyment, Shree Krishna calls it a thieving mentality. Often people ask the question, \u201cI lead a virtuous life; I do not harm anyone, nor do I steal anything. But I do not believe in worshipping God, nor do I believe in him. Am I doing anything wrong?\u201d This question is answered in the above verse. Such persons may not be doing anything wrong in the eyes of humans, but they are thieves in the eyes of God. Let us say, we walk into someone\u2019s house, and without recognizing the owner, we sit on the sofa, eat from the refrigerator, and use the restroom. We may claim that we are not doing anything wrong, but we will be considered thieves in the eyes of the law, because the house does not belong to us. Similarly, the world that we live in was made by God, and everything in it belongs to him. If we utilize his creation for our pleasure, without acknowledging his dominion over it, from the divine perspective we are certainly committing theft.The famous king in Indian history, Chandragupta, asked Chanakya Pundit, his Guru, \u201cAccording to the Vedic scriptures, what is the position of the king vis-\u00e0-vis his subjects?\u201d Chanakya Pundit replied, \u201cThe king is the servant of the subjects and nothing else. His God-given duty is to help the citizens of his kingdom progress in their journey toward God-realization.\u201d Whether one is a king, a businessperson, a farmer, or a worker, each person, as an integral member of God\u2019s world, is expected to do his or her duty as a service to the Supreme."

        "commentary": "In the Vedic tradition, food is cooked with the consciousness that the meal is for the pleasure of God. A portion of the food items is then put in a plate and a verbal or mental prayer is made for the Lord to come and eat it. After the offering, the food in the plate is considered pras\u0101d (grace of God). All the food in the plate and the pots is then accepted as God\u2019s grace and eaten in that consciousness. Other religious traditions follow similar customs. Christianity has the sacrament of the Eucharist, where bread and wine are consecrated and then partaken. Shree Krishna states in this verse that eating pras\u0101d (food that is first offered as sacrifice to God) releases one from sin, while those who eat food without offering commit sin.The question may arise whether we can offer non-vegetarian items to God and then accept the remnants as his pras\u0101d. The answer to this question is that the Vedas prescribe a vegetarian diet for humans, which includes grains, pulses and beans, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, etc. Apart from the Vedic culture, many spiritually evolved souls in the history of all cultures around the world also rejected a non-vegetarian diet that makes the stomach a graveyard for animals. Even though many of them were born in meat-eating families, they gravitated to a vegetarian lifestyle as they advanced on the path of spirituality. Here are quotations from some famous thinkers and personalities advocating vegetarianism:\u201cTo avoid causing terror to living beings, let the disciple refrain from eating meat\u2026 the food of the wise is that which is consumed by the s\u0101dhus; it does not consist of meat.\u201d The Buddha.\u201cIf you declare that you are naturally designed for such a diet, then first kill for yourself what you want to eat. Do it, however, only through your own resources, unaided by cleaver or cudgel or any kind of ax.\u201d The Roman Plutarch, in the essay, \u201cOn Eating Flesh.\u201d\u201cAs long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.\u201d Pythagoras\u201cTruly man is the king of beasts, for his brutality exceeds them. We live by the death of others. We are burial places! I have since an early age abjured the use of meat\u2026\u201d Leonardo da Vinci.\u201cNonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all living beings, we are all savages.\u201d Thomas Edison.\u201cFlesh-eating is simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to moral feeling\u2014killing.\u201d  Leo Tolstoy.\u201cIt may indeed be doubted whether butchers\u2019 meat is anywhere a necessary of life\u2026 Decency nowhere requires that any man should eat butchers\u2019 meat.\u201d Adam Smith.\u201cI look my age. It is the other people who look older than they are. What can you expect from people who eat corpses?\u201d George Bernard Shaw.\u201cA dead cow or sheep lying in a pasture is recognized as carrion. The same sort of carcass dressed and hung up in a butcher\u2019s stall passes as food!\u201d J. H. Kellogg.\u201cIt is my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.\u201d Albert Einstein\u201cI do feel that spiritual progress does demand at some stage that we should cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants.\u201d Mahatma GandhiIn this verse, Shree Krishna goes further and says that even vegetation contains life, and if we eat it for our own sense enjoyment, we get bound in the karmic reactions of destroying life. The word used in the verse is \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t, meaning \u201cfor one\u2019s individual pleasure.\u201d However, if we eat food as remnants of yaj\u00f1a offered to God then the consciousness changes. We then look upon our body as the property of God, which has been put under our care for his service. And we partake of permitted food, as his grace, with the intention that it will nourish the body. In this sentiment, the entire process is consecrated to the Divine. Bharat Muni states:vasusato kratu dak\u1e63hau k\u0101la k\u0101mau d\u1e5biti\u1e25 kuru\u1e25pururav\u0101 madrav\u0101\u015bhcha vi\u015bhwadev\u0101\u1e25 prak\u012brtit\u0101\u1e25 [v8]\u201cViolence is caused unknowingly to living entities in the process of cooking, by the use of the pestle, fire, grinding instruments, water pot, and broom.

These duties have been planned in such a way that through their performance materially engrossed persons may gradually learn to control their desires and slowly elevate themselves from the mode of ignorance to the mode of passion, and from the mode of passion to the mode of goodness. These duties are enjoined to be dedicated to him as yaj\u00f1a.

All members of this universal wheel of action perform their duties and contribute to its smooth rotation. Since we also partake of the fruits of this natural cycle, we too must do our bounden duty in the chain.We humans are the only ones in this chain who have been bestowed with the ability to choose our actions by our own free will. We can thus either contribute to the harmony of the cycle or bring about discord in the smooth running of this cosmic mechanism. When the majority of the people of human society accept their responsibility to live as integral parts of the universal system, material prosperity abounds and spiritual growth is engendered. Such periods become golden eras in the social and cultural history of humankind. Conversely, when a major section of humankind begins to violate the universal system and rejects its responsibility as an integral part of the cosmic system, then material nature begins to punish, and peace and prosperity become scarce.The wheel of nature has been set up by God for disciplining, training, and elevating all living beings of varying levels of consciousness. Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that those who do not perform the yaj\u00f1a enjoined of them become slaves of their senses and lead a sinful existence. Thus, they live in vain.

        "commentary": "Only those who have given up desires for external objects can rejoice and be satisfied in the self. The root of bondage is our material desires, \u201cThis should happen; that should not happen.\u201d Shree Krishna explains a little further ahead in this chapter (in verse 3.37) that desire is the cause of all sins, consequently, it must be renounced. As explained previously (in the purport of verse 2.64), it must be borne in mind that whenever Shree Krishna says we should give up desire, he refers to material desires, and not to the aspirations for spiritual progress or the desire to realize God.However, why do material desires arise in the first place? When we identify the self with the body, we identify with the yearnings of the body and mind as the desires of the self, and these send us spinning into the realm of Maya. Sage Tulsidas explains:jiba jiba te hari te bilag\u0101no taba te deha geha nija m\u0101nyo,m\u0101y\u0101 basa swar\u016bp bisar\u0101yo tehi brama te d\u0101ru\u1e47a du\u1e25kh p\u0101yo. [ v13]\u201cWhen the soul separated itself from God, the material energy covered it in an illusion. By virtue of that illusion, it began thinking of itself as the body, and ever since, in forgetfulness of the self, it has been experiencing immense misery.\u201dThose who are illumined realize that the self is not material in nature, but divine, and hence imperishable. The perishable objects of the world can never fulfill the thirst of the imperishable soul, and therefore it is a folly to hanker after those sense-objects. Thus, self-illumined souls learn to unite their consciousness with God and experience his infinite bliss within them.The karm (duties) prescribed for the materially conditioned souls are no longer applicable to such illumined souls because they have already attained the goal of all such karm. For example, as long as one is a college student, one is obliged to follow the rules of the university, but for one who has graduated and earned the degree, the rules now become irrelevant. For such liberated souls, it is said: brahmavit \u015bhruti m\u016brdhn\u012b[v14] \u201cThose who have united themselves with God now walk on the head of the Vedas,\u201d i.e. they have no need to follow the rules of the Vedas any longer.The goal of the Vedas is to help unite the soul with God. Once the soul becomes God-realized, the rules of the Vedas, which helped the soul to reach that destination, now no longer apply; the soul has transcended their area of jurisdiction. For example, a pundit unites a man and woman in wedlock by performing the marriage ceremony. Once the ceremony is over, he says, \u201cYou are now husband and wife; I am leaving.\u201d His task is over. If the wife says, \u201cPunditji, the vows you made us take during the marriage ceremony are not being followed by my husband, the pundit will reply, \u201cThat is not my area of expertise. My duty was to get you both united in marriage and that work is over.\u201d Similarly the Vedas are there to help unite the self with the Supreme Self. When God-realization takes place, the task of the Vedas is over. Such an enlightened soul is no longer obliged to perform the Vedic duties."

This was necessary to purify the mind, helping it rise above worldly contamination. But self-realized souls have already reached absorption in God and developed purity of mind. These transcendentalists are directly engaged in bhakti, or pure spiritual activities, such as meditation, worship, k\u012brtan, service to the Guru, etc. If such souls reject their worldly duties, it is not considered a sin. They may continue to perform worldly duties if they wish, but they are not obliged to do them.Historically, Saints have been of two kinds. 1) Those like Prahlad, Dhruv, Ambarish, Prithu, and Vibheeshan, who continued to discharge their worldly duties even after attaining the transcendental platform. These were the karm yogis\u2014externally they were doing their duties with their body while internally their minds were attached to God. 2) Those like Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who rejected their worldly duties and accepted the renounced order of life. These were the karm sany\u0101s\u012bs, who were both internally and externally, with both body and mind, engaged only in devotion to God. In this verse, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that both options exist for the self-realized sage. Now, he states this in the next verse which of these he recommends to Arjun."

In verses 3.17 and 3.18, he stated that the transcendentalist is not obliged to perform prescribed duties. So, what path is more suitable for Arjun? Shree Krishna\u2019s recommendation for him is to be a karm yogi, and not take karm sany\u0101s. He explains the reason for this in verses 3.20 to 3.26."

Leaders of society thus have a moral responsibility to set lofty examples for inspiring the rest of the population by their words, deeds, and character. When noble leaders are in the forefront, the rest of society naturally gets uplifted in morality, selflessness, and spiritual strength. But in times when there is a vacuum of principled leadership, the rest of society has no standards to pursue and slumps into self-centeredness, moral bankruptcy, and spiritual lassitude. Hence, great personalities should always act in an exemplary manner to set the standard for the world.

The leader may be at the transcendental platform and therefore eligible to renounce work and engage completely in spirituality. However, others in society use their example as an excuse for escapism, to run away from their responsibilities. Such escapists cite the instances of the great karm sany\u0101s\u012bs, such as Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

In India, we find thousands of such sadhus. They copy the examples of the great sany\u0101s\u012bs and don the ochre robes, without the concurrent internal enlightenment and bliss.

This will help them learn to discipline their mind and senses, and slowly rise to the transcendental platform. Hence, to present an example for society to follow, Shree Krishna suggests that Arjun should practice karm yog. He now gives his own example to illustrate the above point."

Since, we have not attained perfect bliss as yet, we feel dissatisfied and incomplete. So whatever we do is for the sake of attaining bliss. However, bliss is one of God\u2019s energies and he alone possesses it to the infinite extent. He is perfect and complete in himself and has no need of anything outside of himself. Thus, he is also called \u0100tm\u0101r\u0101m (one who rejoices in the self), \u0100tma-rat\u012b (one who is attracted to his or her own self), and \u0100tma-kr\u012b\u1e0da (one who performs divine pastimes with his or her own self).If such a personality does work, there can be only one reason for it\u2014it will not be for oneself, rather for the welfare of others. Thus, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that although in his personal form as Shree Krishna, he has no duty to perform in the universe, yet he works for the welfare of others. He next explains the welfare that is accomplished when he works."

Had Shree Krishna failed to perform Vedic duties, human beings following his example would be led away from the discipline of karm, into a state of chaos. This would have been a very serious offence and Lord Krishna would be considered at fault. Thus, he explains to Arjun that if he did not fulfill his occupational duties, it would cause pandemonium in society.Similarly, Arjun was world-famous for being undefeated in battle, and was the brother of the virtuous King Yudhisthir. If Arjun refused to fulfill his duty to protect dharma, then many other worthy and noble warriors could follow his example and also renounce their prescribed duty of protecting righteousness. This would bring destruction to the world balance and the rout of innocent and virtuous people. Thus, for the benefit of the entire human race and the welfare of the world, Shree Krishna coaxed Arjun not to neglect performing his prescribed Vedic activities."

They are called ignorant because though they have bookish knowledge of the scriptures, they do not comprehend the final goal of God-realization. Such ignorant people perform their duty scrupulously according to the ordinance of the scriptures, without indolence or doubt. They have firm faith that the performance of Vedic duties and rituals will bring the material rewards they desire. If the faith of such people in rituals is broken, without their having developed faith in the higher principle of devotion, they will have nowhere to go. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:t\u0101vat karm\u0101\u1e47i kurv\u012bta na nirvidyeta y\u0101vat\u0101mat-kath\u0101-\u015bhrava\u1e47\u0101dau v\u0101 \u015bhraddh\u0101 y\u0101van na j\u0101yate (11.20.9)[v16]\u201cOne should continue to perform karm as long as one has not developed renunciation from the sense objects and attachment to God.\u201dShree Krishna urges Arjun that just as ignorant people faithfully perform ritualistic duties, so also the wise should perform their works dutifully, not for material rewards, but for setting an ideal for the rest of society. Besides, the particular situation in which Arjun finds himself is a dharma yuddha (war of righteousness). Thus, for the welfare of society, Arjun should perform his duty as a warrior."

So Shree Krishna urges that wise people should not perform any actions or make any utterances that lead the ignorant toward downfall. It may be argued that if the wise feel compassion for the ignorant, they should give them the highest knowledge\u2014the knowledge of God-realization. Lord Krishna neutralizes this argument by stating na buddhi-bheda\u1e41 janayet, meaning the ignorant should not be asked to abandon duties by giving superior instructions they are not qualified to understand.Usually, people in material consciousness consider only two options. Either they are willing to work hard for fruitive results or they wish to give up all exertions on the plea that all works are laborious, painful, and wrought with evil. Between these, working for results is far superior to the escapist approach. Hence, the spiritually wise in Vedic knowledge should inspire the ignorant to perform their duties with attentiveness and care. If the minds of the ignorant become disturbed and unsettled then they may lose faith in working altogether, and with actions stopped and knowledge not arising, the ignorant will lose out from both sides.If both the ignorant and the wise perform Vedic actions, then what is the difference between them? Apprehending such a question, Shree Krishna explains this in the next two verses."

        "commentary": "We can see that the natural phenomena of the world are not directed by us, but are performed by prak\u1e5biti, or Mother Nature. Now, for the actions of our own body, we usually divide them into two categories: 1) Natural biological functions, such as digestion, blood circulation, heartbeat, etc., which we do not consciously execute but which occur naturally. 2) Actions such as speaking, hearing, walking, sleeping, working etc. that we think we perform.Both these categories of works are performed by the mind-body-senses mechanism. All the parts of this mechanism are made from prak\u1e5biti, or the material energy, which consists of the three modes (gu\u1e47as)\u2014goodness (sattva), passion (rajas), and ignorance (tamas). Just as waves are not separate from the ocean, but a part of it, similarly the body is a part of Mother Nature from which it is created. Hence, material energy is the doer of everything.Why then does the soul perceive itself to be doing activities? The reason is that, in the grip of the unforgiving ego, the soul falsely identifies itself with the body. Hence, it remains under the illusion of doership. Let us say there are two trains standing side-by-side on the railway platform, and a passenger on one train fixes his gaze on the other. When the second train moves, it seems that the first is moving. Likewise the immobile soul identifies with the mobility of prak\u1e5biti. Thus, it perceives itself as the doer of actions. The moment the soul eliminates the ego and surrenders to the will of God, it realizes itself as the non-doer.One may question that if the soul is truly the non-doer, then why is it implicated in law of karma for actions performed by the body? The reason is that the soul does not itself perform actions, but it does direct the actions of the senses-mind-intellect. For example, a chariot driver does not pull the chariot himself, but he does direct the horses. Now, if there is any accident, it is not the horses that are blamed, but the driver who was directing them. Similarly, the soul is held responsible for the actions of the mind-body mechanism because the senses-mind-intellect work on receiving inspiration from the soul."

Having thus abolished the ego, they are free from bodily identifications, and are able to discern their spiritual identity distinct from the corporeal body. Hence, they are not beguiled into thinking of themselves as the doers of their material actions, and instead they attribute every activity to the movements of the three gu\u1e47as.

Infatuated by the three modes of material nature, they work for the express purpose of being able to enjoy sensual and mental delights. They are unable to perform actions as a matter of duty, without desiring rewards.However, the k\u1e5bitsna-vit (persons with knowledge) should not disturb the minds of the ak\u1e5bitsna-vit (persons without knowledge). This means that the wise should not force their thoughts onto ignorant persons by saying, \u201cYou are the soul, not the body, and hence karm is meaningless; give it up.\u201d Rather, they should instruct the ignorant to perform their respective karm, and slowly help them rise above attachment.

Philosophers and teachers name their opinion as principle, but in the Gita, the Lord has named the principle explained by him as opinion. By his example, he is teaching us humility and cordiality.Having given the call for action, Shree Krishna now points out the virtues of accepting the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita with faith and following them in one\u2019s life. Our prerogative as humans is to know the truth and then modify our lives accordingly. In this way, our mental fever (of lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, etc.) gets pacified.In the previous verse, Shree Krishna had clearly explained to Arjun to offer all works to him. But he knows that this statement can cause ridicule from those who have no belief in God and rebuke from those who are envious of him. So, he now emphasizes the need for accepting the teachings with conviction. He says that by faithfully following these teachings one becomes free from the bondage of karma.

However, our material intellect has innumerable imperfections, and so we are not always able to comprehend the sublimity of his teachings or appreciate their benefits. If we could, what would be the difference between us tiny souls and the Supreme Divine Personality? Thus, faith becomes a necessary ingredient for accepting the divine teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Wherever our intellect is unable to comprehend, rather than finding fault with the teachings, we must submit our intellect, \u201cShree Krishna has said it. There must be veracity in it, which I cannot understand at present. Let me accept it for now and engage in spiritual s\u0101dhan\u0101. I will be able to comprehend it in future, when I progress in spirituality through s\u0101dhan\u0101.\u201d This attitude is called \u015bhraddh\u0101, or faith.Jagadguru Shankaracharaya defines \u015bhraddh\u0101 as:\u00a0guru ved\u0101nta v\u0101kye\u1e63hu d\u1e5bi\u1e0dho vi\u015bhv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bhraddh\u0101 [v18]\u201c\u015ahraddh\u0101 is strong faith in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.\u201dChaitanya Mahaprabhu explained it similarly:\u00a0\u015bhraddh\u0101 \u015bhabde vi\u015bhw\u0101sa kahe sud\u1e5bi\u1e0dha ni\u015bhchaya\u00a0(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, Madhya Leela, 22.62)[v19] \u201cThe word \u015ahraddh\u0101 means strong faith in God and Guru, even though we may not comprehend their message at present.\u201dThe British poet, Alfred Tennyson said: \u201cBy faith alone, embrace believing, where we cannot prove.\u201d So, \u015bhraddh\u0101 means earnestly digesting the comprehensible portions of the Bhagavad Gita, and also accepting the abstruse portions, with the hope that they will become comprehensible in future.However, one of the persistent defects of the material intellect is pride. Due to pride, whatever the intellect cannot comprehend at present, it often rejects as incorrect. Though Shree Krishna\u2019s teachings are presented by the omniscient Lord for the welfare of the souls, people still find fault in them, such as, \u201cWhy is God asking everything to be offered to him? Is he greedy? Is he an egotist that he asks Arjun to worship him?\u201d Shree Krishna says that such people are achetasa\u1e25, or \u201cdevoid of discrimination,\u201d because they cannot distinguish between the pure and the impure, the righteous and the unrighteous, the Creator and the created, the Supreme Master and the servant. Such people \u201cbring about their own ruin,\u201d because they reject the path to eternal salvation and keep rotating in the cycle of life and death."

Propelled by their natures, people are inclined to act in accordance with their individual modes. Even those who are theoretically learned carry with them the baggage of the sansk\u0101rs (tendencies and impressions) of endless past lives, the pr\u0101rabdh karma of this life, and the individual traits of their minds and intellects. They find it difficult to resist this force of habit and nature. If the Vedic scriptures instructed them to give up all works and engage in pure spirituality, it would create an unstable situation. Such artificial repression would be counter-productive. The proper and easier way for spiritual advancement is to utilize the immense force of habit and tendencies and dovetail it in the direction of God. We have to begin the spiritual ascent from where we stand, and doing so requires we have to first accept our present condition of what we are and then improve on it.We can see how even animals act according to their unique natures. Ants are such social creatures that they bring food for the community while forsaking it themselves, a quality that is difficult to find in human society. A cow has such intense attachment for its calf that the moment it goes out of its sight, the cow feels disturbed. Dogs display the virtue of loyalty to depths that cannot be matched by the best of humans. Similarly, we humans too are propelled by our natures. Since Arjun was a warrior by nature, Shree Krishna told him, \u201cIf, motivated by pride, you think, \u201cI shall not fight,\u201d your decision will be in vain. Your own nature will compel you to fight.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 18.59) \u201cO Arjun, that action which out of delusion you do not wish to do, you will be driven to do it by your own inclination, born of your own material nature.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 18.60) That nature should be sublimated by shifting the goal from worldly enjoyment to God-realization, and performing our prescribed duty without attachment and aversion, in the spirit of service to God."

As long as we have the material body, for its maintenance, we have to utilize the objects of the senses. Shree Krishna is not asking us to stop consuming what is necessary, but to practice eradicating attachment and aversion. Definitely sansk\u0101rs (past life tendencies) do have a deep-rooted influence on all living beings, but if we practice the method taught in the Bhagavad Gita, we can succeed in correcting the situation.The senses naturally run toward the sense objects and their mutual interaction creates sensations of pleasure and pain. For example, the taste buds experience joy in contact with delicious foods and distress in contact with bitter foods. The mind repeatedly contemplates the sensations of pleasure and pain which it associates with these objects. Thoughts of pleasure in the sense objects create attachment while thoughts of pain create aversion. Shree Krishna tells Arjun to succumb neither to feelings of attachment nor aversion.In the discharge of our worldly duty, we will have to encounter all kinds of likeable and unlikeable situations. We must practice neither to yearn for the likeable situations, nor to avoid the unlikeable situations. When we stop being slaves of both the likes and dislikes of the mind and senses, we will overcome our lower nature. And when we become indifferent to both pleasure and pain in the discharge of our duty, we will become truly free to act from our higher nature."

By asking Arjun to follow his swa-dharma, Shree Krishna is telling him to follow his profession, and not change it because someone else may be doing something else.It is more enjoyable to be ourselves than to pretend to be someone else. The duties born of our nature can be easily performed with stability of mind. The duties of others may seem attractive from a distance and we may think of switching, but that is a risky thing to do. If they conflict with our nature, they will create disharmony in our senses, mind, and intellect. This will be detrimental for our consciousness and will hinder our progress on the spiritual path. Shree Krishna emphasizes this point dramatically by saying that it is better to die in the faithful performance of one\u2019s duty than to be in the unnatural position of doing another\u2019s duty."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna stated in the previous verse that one should not come under the influence of attraction and aversion. Arjun wishes to lead such a divine life, but finds the advice difficult to implement. So he asks Shree Krishna a question that is very realistic and representative of the human struggle. He says, \u201cWhat force prevents us from reaching this high ideal? What makes one succumb to attachment and aversion?\u201dWe all have a conscience that makes us feel remorseful while committing a sin. The conscience is grounded in the fact that God is the abode of virtue, and as his fragments, we all have an innate attraction for virtue and goodness. The goodness that is the nature of the soul gives rise to the voice of conscience. Thus, we cannot make the excuse that we did not know stealing, swindling, libel, extortion, murder, oppression, and corruption are sinful activities. We intuitively know these deeds to be sinful, and yet we commit such acts, as if some strong force impels to do them. Arjun wishes to know what that strong force is."

        "commentary": "The Vedas use the word k\u0101m, or lust, not only for sexual desires but also to include all desires for material enjoyment based on the bodily concept of the self. Thus, lust shows itself in many ways\u2014the urge for money, physical cravings, craving for prestige, the drive for power, etc. This lust is only a perverted reflection of love for God, which is the inherent nature of every living being. When the soul associates with the material energy in the form of the body, its divine love for God is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Since divine love is the highest power of God, its perversion in the material realm, which is lust, is also the most powerful force in worldly activities.Shree Krishna identifies this \u201clust\u201d for worldly enjoyment as the cause of sin, as the malignant allure sitting within us. The mode of passion deludes the soul into believing that worldly objects will give satisfaction, and so one creates desires for acquiring them. When desire is satisfied, it gives birth to greed; when it is not satisfied, it gives rise to anger. One commits sins under the influence of all three\u2014lust, greed, and anger. Greed is nothing but intensified desire, while anger is frustrated desire. Hence, Shree Krishna labels lust, or desire, as the root of all evil."

        "commentary": "Knowledge of what is right and what is wrong is called discrimination. This discrimination resides in the intellect. However, lust is such a formidable adversary that it clouds the discriminatory ability of the intellect. Shree Krishna gives three grades of examples to illustrate this principle. Fire, which is the source of light, gets covered by smoke. This partial obscuring is like the thin cloud that s\u0101ttvic desires create. A mirror, which is naturally reflective, gets obscured by dust. This semi-opacity is like the masking impact of r\u0101jasic desires on the intellect. And an embryo gets concealed in the womb. This complete obfuscation is like the consequence of t\u0101masic desires subverting the power of discrimination. Similarly, in proportion to the grade of our desires, the spiritual knowledge we may have heard and read gets shrouded.There is a beautiful allegorical story to illustrate this point. A man used to take his evening walk by the side of a forest. One evening, he decided to walk in the forest instead. When he had walked a couple of miles, the sun began setting and the light started fading. He turned around to walk out of the forest, but to his dismay he found that animals had gathered on the other side. These ferocious animals started chasing him and to escape from them, he ran deeper into the forest. While running, he found a witch standing in front of him with open arms to embrace him. To escape her, he turned direction and ran perpendicular to the animals and the witch. By then, it had become dark. Unable to see much, he ran over a ditch that was covered by vine hanging from a tree. He fell headlong, but his feet became entangled in the vine. As a result, he began hanging upside down above the ditch. After a few moments he came to his senses and saw a snake sitting at the bottom of the ditch, waiting to bite him if he fell down. In the meantime, two mice appeared\u2014one white and one black\u2014and started nibbling at the branch from which the vine was hanging. To confound his problems, some wasps gathered and began stinging him on his face. In this precarious situation, it was found that the man was smiling. Philosophers gathered to ponder how he could smile in such a dire strait. They looked upwards and found a beehive, from which honey was dripping onto his tongue. He was licking the honey and thinking how pleasurable it was; he had forgotten the animals, the witch, the snake, the mice, and the wasps.The person in the story may seem insane to us. However, this tale depicts the condition of all humans under the influence of desire. The forest in which the man was walking represents the material world in which we live, where there is danger at every step. The animals that chased him represent diseases that begin to appear in life, and continue harassing us until death. The witch represented old age that is waiting to embrace us with the passage of time. The snake at the bottom of the pit is like the inevitable death that awaits us all. The white and black mice that were nibbling on the branch represent day and night, which are steadily reducing our life and bringing us closer to death. The wasps that were stinging the face are like the innumerable desires that arise in the mind and agitate it, causing us pain and distress. Honey represents the sensual enjoyment we experience in the world, which clouds the discrimination of our intellect. Hence, forgetting our precarious position, we remain absorbed in enjoying the temporary delights of the senses. Shree Krishna states that it is this type of lustful desire that is responsible for shrouding our power of discrimination."

The fortress of the enemy must be spotted before one can lay siege on it. In this verse, Shree Krishna states that the senses, mind, and intellect are the places from where lust exercises its dominion over the soul. Under the sway of lust, the sense objects are desired by the senses, the senses infatuate the mind, the mind misleads the intellect, and the intellect loses its discriminatory powers. When the intellect is clouded, the living being is deluded to become a slave of lust and will do anything to satiate it.These instruments\u2014senses, mind, and intellect\u2014are not bad in themselves. They were given to us for the purpose of achieving God-realization, but we have permitted lust in its many forms to lay siege on them.

Having identified the repositories of lust, Shree Krishna asks Arjun, at the outset, to curb the desires of the senses. Permitting them to arise is the cause of our miseries, while eliminating them is the way to peace.Consider the following example. Ramesh and Dinesh were two fellow students sharing the same room in the hostel. At 10 pm at night, Ramesh developed the desire to smoke cigarettes. He said, \u201cI am getting the urge to smoke.\u201d Dinesh replied, \u201cIt is so late at night. Forget about cigarettes and go to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026no\u2026I will not be able to sleep until I puff the tobacco,\u201d said Ramesh. Dinesh went to sleep, but Ramesh went out in search of cigarettes. The shops nearby had closed. It took him two hours until he finally returned to the hostel with the cigarette and had a smoke.In the morning, Dinesh asked him, \u201cRamesh, when did you sleep at night?\u201d \u201cAt midnight.\u201d \u201cReally! That means you remained agitated for cigarettes for two hours and when you had your puffs, you returned to the same state that you were in at 10 pm.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d asked Ramesh. \u201cLook, at 10 pm you did not have any desire for cigarettes, and you were peaceful. Then you yourself created the desire for them. From 10 pm to midnight, you remained agitated for cigarettes. Finally, when you smoked them, the disease, which you had created, went away, and you got to sleep. I, on the other hand, did not create any desire, and slept peacefully at 10 pm itself.\u201dIn this way, we create desires for the objects of the senses of the body, and then become agitated by them. When we get the cherished object, the disease of our own creation gets eradicated, and we think of it as happiness.\u201d However, if we think of ourselves as the soul and our only purpose is happiness of the soul, then it becomes easier to renounce such material desires. Shree Krishna tells Arjun to bring the senses under control, thereby slaying the lust residing in them. To accomplish this we must use the higher instruments given by God to us, as stated in the next verse."

        "commentary": "In conclusion, Shree Krishna emphasizes that we should slay this enemy called lust through knowledge of the self. Since the soul is a part of God, it is divine in nature. Thus, the divine bliss it seeks can only be attained from a divine subject, while the objects of the world are all material. These material objects can never fulfill the innate longing of the soul and so it is futile to create desires for them. We must exert and train the intellect to think in this manner, and then use it to control the mind and the senses.This is explained very beautifully in the Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had with the help of the model of a chariot:\u0101tm\u0101nagva\u1e41 rathina\u1e41 viddhi \u015bhar\u012bra\u1e41 rathameva tubuddhi\u1e41 tu s\u0101rathi\u1e41 viddhi mana\u1e25 pragrahameva chaindriy\u0101\u1e47i hay\u0101n\u0101hurvi\u1e63hay\u0101nste\u1e63hu gochar\u0101n\u0101tmendriyamanoyukta\u1e41 bhoktety\u0101hurman\u012b\u1e63hi\u1e47a\u1e25 (1.3.3-4) [v21]The Upani\u1e63hads say there is a chariot, which has five horses pulling it; the horses have reins in their mouths, which are in the hands of a charioteer; a passenger is sitting at the back of the chariot. Ideally, the passenger should instruct the charioteer, who should then control the reins and guide the horses in the proper direction. However, in this case, the passenger has gone to sleep, and so the horses are holding sway.In this analogy, the chariot is the body, the horses are the five senses, the reins in the mouth of the horses is the mind, the charioteer is the intellect, and the passenger seated behind is the soul residing in the body. The senses (horses) desire pleasurable things. The mind (reins) is not exercising restraint on the senses (horses). The intellect (charioteer) submits to the pull of the reins (mind). So in the materially bound state, the bewildered soul does not direct the intellect in the proper direction. Thus, the senses decide the direction where the chariot will go. The soul experiences the pleasures of the senses vicariously, but these do not satisfy it. Seated on this chariot, the soul (passenger) is moving around in this material world since eternity.However, if the soul wakes up to its higher nature and decides to take a proactive role, it can exercise the intellect in the proper direction. The intellect will then govern the lower self\u2014the mind and the senses\u2014and the chariot will move in the direction of eternal welfare. In this way, the higher self (soul) must be used to control the lower self (senses, mind, and, intellect)."

        "commentary": "Merely imparting invaluable knowledge to someone is not enough. The recipients of that knowledge must appreciate its value and have faith in its authenticity. Only then will they put in the effort required to implement it practically in their lives. In this verse, Shree Krishna establishes the credibility and importance of the spiritual wisdom he is bestowing on Arjun. Shree Krishna informs Arjun that the knowledge being imparted unto him is not newly created for the convenience of motivating him into battle. It is the same eternal science of Yog that he originally taught to Vivasvan, or Surya, Sun God, who imparted it to Manu, the original progenitor of humankind; Manu in turn taught it to Ikshvaku, first king of the Solar dynasty. This is the descending process of knowledge, where someone who is a perfect authority on the knowledge passes it down to another who wishes to know.In contrast to this is the ascending process of acquiring knowledge, where one endeavors to enhance the frontiers of understanding through self-effort. The ascending process is laborious, imperfect, and time-consuming. For example, if we wish to learn Physics, we could either try to do it by the ascending process, where we speculate about its principles with our own intellect and then reach conclusions, or we could do it by the descending process, where we approach a good teacher of the subject. The ascending process is exceedingly time-consuming, and we may not even be able to complete the inquiry in our lifetime. We can also not be sure about the validity of our conclusions. In comparison, the descending process gives us instant access to the deepest secrets of Physics. If our teacher has perfect knowledge of Physics, then it is very straightforward\u2014simply listen to the science from him and digest what he says. This descending process of receiving knowledge is both easy and faultless.Every year, thousands of self-help books are released in the market, which present the authors\u2019 solutions to the problems encountered in life. These books may be helpful in a limited way, but because they are based upon the ascending process of attaining knowledge, they are imperfect. Every few years, a new theory comes along that overthrows the current ones. This ascending process is unsuitable for knowing the Absolute Truth. Divine knowledge does not need to be created by self-effort. It is the energy of God, and has existed ever since he has existed, just as heat and light are as old as the fire from which they emanate.God and the individual soul are both eternal, and so the science of Yog that unites the soul and God is also eternal. There is no need to speculate and formulate new theories about it. An amazing endorsement of this truism is the Bhagavad Gita itself, which continues to astound people with the sagacity of its perennial wisdom that remains relevant to our daily lives even fifty centuries after it was spoken. Shree Krishna states here that the knowledge of Yog, which he is revealing to Arjun, is eternal and it was passed down in ancient times through the descending process, from Guru to disciple."

It was in such a tradition that saintly kings like Nimi and Janak understood the science of Yog. This tradition starts from God himself, who is the first Guru of the world.tene brahma h\u1e5bid\u0101 ya \u0101di-kavaye muhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25  (Bh\u0101gavatam 1.1.1)[v1]God revealed this knowledge at the beginning of creation in the heart of the first-born Brahma, and the tradition continued from him. Shree Krishna stated in the last verse that he also revealed this knowledge to the Sun God, Vivasvan, from whom the tradition continued as well. However, the nature of this material world is such, that with the passage of time, this knowledge got lost. Materially-minded and insincere disciples interpret the teachings according to their blemished perspectives. Within a few generations, its pristine purity is contaminated. When this happens, by his causeless grace, God reestablishes the tradition for the benefit of humankind. He may do so, either by himself descending in the world, or through a great God-realized Saint, who becomes a conduit for God\u2019s work on Earth.Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj, who is the fifth original Jagadguru in Indian history, is such a God-inspired Saint who has reestablished the ancient knowledge in modern times. When he was only thirty-four years old, the Kashi Vidvat Parishat, the supreme body of 500 Vedic scholars in the holy city of Kashi, honored him with the title of Jagadguru, or \u201cSpiritual Master of the world.\u201d He became the fifth Saint in Indian history to receive the original title of Jagadguru, after Jagadguru Shankaracharya, Jagadguru Nimbarkacharya, Jagadguru Ramanujacharya, and Jagadguru Madhvacharya. This commentary on the Bhagavad Gita has been written based upon its insightful understanding, as revealed to me by Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna tells Arjun that the ancient science being imparted to him is an uncommonly known secret. Secrecy in the world is maintained for two reasons: either due to selfishness in keeping the truth to oneself, or to protect the abuse of knowledge. The science of Yog remains a secret, not for either of these reasons, but because it requires a qualification to be understood. That qualification is revealed in this verse as devotion. The deep message of the Bhagavad Gita is not amenable to being understood merely through scholasticism or mastery of the Sanskrit language. It requires devotion, which destroys the subtle envy of the soul toward God and enables us to accept the humble position as his tiny parts and servitors.Arjun was a fit student of this science because he was a devotee of the Lord. Devotion to God can be practiced in any of the five sequentially higher bh\u0101vas, or sentiments: 1) \u015ah\u0101nt bh\u0101v: adoring God as our King. 2) D\u0101sya bhav: the sentiment of servitude toward God as our Master. 3) Sakhya bh\u0101v: considering God as our Friend. 4) V\u0101tsalya bh\u0101v: considering God as our Child. 5) M\u0101dhurya bh\u0101v: worshipping God as our Soul-beloved. Arjun worshipped God as his Friend, and so Shree Krishna speaks to him as his friend and devotee.Without a devotional heart, one cannot truly grasp the message of the Bhagavad Gita. This verse also invalidates the commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita written by scholars, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yogis, tapasv\u012bs, etc., who lack bhakti (devotion) toward God. According to this verse, since they are not devotees, they cannot comprehend the true import of the supreme science that was revealed to Arjun, and hence their commentaries are inaccurate and/or incomplete."

The president of a country sometimes decides to visit the prison, but if we see the president standing in the jail, we do not erroneously conclude that he is also a convict. We know that he is in the jail merely for an inspection. Similarly, God sometimes descends in the material world, but he is never divested of his divine attributes and powers.In his commentary upon this verse, Shankaracharya states: y\u0101 v\u0101sudeve an\u012b\u015bhvar\u0101sarvaj\u00f1\u0101\u015bha\u1e45k\u0101 m\u016brkh\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 t\u0101\u1e41 pariharan \u015bhr\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101cha (\u015ah\u0101r\u012brak Bh\u0101\u1e63hya on verse 4.5)[v2] \u201cThis verse has been spoken by Shree Krishna to refute foolish people who doubt that he is not God.\u201d Non-believers argue that Shree Krishna too was born like the rest of us, and he ate, drank, slept, like we all do, and so he could not have been God. Here, Shree Krishna emphasizes the difference between the soul and God by stating that although he descends in the world innumerable times, he still remains omniscient, unlike the soul whose knowledge is finite.The individual soul and the Supreme Soul, God, have many similarities\u2014both are sat-chit-\u0101nand (eternal, sentient, and blissful). However, there are also many differences. God is all-pervading, while the soul only pervades the body it inhabits; God is all-powerful, while the soul does not even have the power to liberate itself from Maya without God\u2019s grace; God is the creator of the laws of nature, while the soul is subject to these laws; God is the upholder of the entire creation, while the soul is upheld by him; God is all-knowing, while the soul does not have complete knowledge even in one subject.Shree Krishna calls Arjun in this verse as \u201cParantapa,\u201d meaning \u201csubduer of the enemies.\u201d He implies, \u201cArjun, you are a valiant warrior who has slayed so many powerful enemies.

        "commentary": "Many people revolt at the idea of a God who possesses a form. They are more comfortable with a formless God, who is all-pervading, incorporeal, and subtle. God is definitely incorporeal and formless, but that does not mean that he cannot simultaneously have a form as well. Since God is all-powerful, he has the power to manifest in a form if he wishes. If someone stipulates that God cannot have a form, it means that person does not accept him as all-powerful. Thus to say, \u201cGod is formless,\u201d is an incomplete statement. On the other hand, to say, \u201cGod manifests in a personal form,\u201d is also only a partial truth. The all-powerful God has both aspects to his divine personality\u2014the personal form and the formless aspect. Hence, the B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had states:dwe v\u0101va brahma\u1e47o r\u016bpe m\u016brta\u1e41 chaiva am\u016brta\u1e41 cha  (2.3.1)[v3]\u201cGod appears in both ways\u2014as the formless Brahman and as the personal God.\u201d They are both dimensions of his personality.In fact, the individual soul also has these two dimensions to its existence. It is formless, and hence, when it leaves the body upon death, it cannot be seen. Yet it takes on a body\u2014not once, but innumerable times\u2014as it transmigrates from birth to birth. When the tiny soul is able to possess a body, can the all-powerful God not have a form? Or is it that God says, \u201cI do not have the power to manifest in a form, and hence I am only a formless light.\u201d For him to be perfect and complete, he must be both personal and formless.The difference is that while our form is created from the material energy, Maya, God\u2019s form is created by his divine energy, Yogmaya. It is thus divine, and beyond material defects. This has been nicely stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47:yastu nirgu\u1e47a ityukta\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101stre\u1e63hu jagad\u012b\u015bhvara\u1e25pr\u0101k\u1e5bitairheya sanyuktairgu\u1e47airh\u012bnatvamuchyate  [v4]\u201cWherever the Vedic scriptures state that God does not have a form, they imply that his form is not subject to the blemishes of the material energy; rather, it is a divine form.\u201d"

However, the Vedic scriptures state that there are innumerable descensions of God:janma-karm\u0101bhidh\u0101n\u0101ni santi me \u2019\u1e45ga sahasra\u015bha\u1e25na \u015bhakyante \u2019nusa\u1e45khy\u0101tum anantatv\u0101n may\u0101pi hi(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.51.37)[v5]\u201cNobody can count the infinite Avatars of God since the beginning of eternity.\u201d These Avatars are classified in four categories, as stated below:1. \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014when God manifests his special powers in an individual soul and acts through him. The sage Narad is an example of \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r. The Buddha is also an example of \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r.2. Pr\u0101bhav\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014these are the descensions of God in the personal form, where he displays some of his divine powers. Pr\u0101bhav\u0101vat\u0101rs are also of two kinds:a) Where God reveals himself only for a few moments, completes his work, and then departs. Hansavatar is an example of this, where God manifested before the Kumaras, answered their question, and left.b) Where the Avatar remains on the earth for many years. Ved Vyas, who wrote the eighteen Puranas and the Mahabharat, and divided the Vedas into four parts, is an example of such an Avatar.3. Vaibhavat\u0101r\u2014when God descends in his divine form, and manifests more of his divine powers. Matsyavatar, Kurmavatar, Varahavatar are all examples of Vaibhavat\u0101rs.4. Par\u0101vasth\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014when God manifests all his divine powers in his personal divine form. Shree Krishna, Shree Ram, and Nrisinghavatar are all Par\u0101vasth\u0101vat\u0101r.This classification does not imply that any one Avat\u0101r is bigger than the other. Ved Vyas, who is himself an Avat\u0101r, clearly states this: sarve p\u016br\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101\u015bhvat\u0101\u015bhcha deh\u0101stasya param\u0101tmana\u1e25 (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47)[v6] \u201cAll the descensions of God are replete with all divine powers; they are all perfect and complete.\u201d Hence, we should not differentiate one Avatar as bigger and another as smaller. However, in each descension, God manifests his powers based on the objectives he wishes to accomplish during that particular descension. The remaining powers reside latently within the Avatar. Hence, the above classifications were created."

        "commentary": "Having stated in the last verse that God descends in the world, he now states the three reasons for doing so: 1) To annihilate the wicked. 2) To protect the pious. 3) To establish dharma. However, if we closely study these three points, none of the three reasons seem very convincing:To protect the righteous. God is seated in the hearts of his devotees, and always protects them from within. There is no need to take an Avatar for this purpose.To annihilate the wicked. God is all-powerful, and can kill the wicked merely by wishing it. Why should he have to take an Avatar to accomplish this?To establish dharma.  Dharma is eternally described in the Vedas. God can reestablish it through a Saint; he does not need to descend himself, in his personal form, to accomplish this.How then do we make sense of the reasons that have been stated in this verse? Let\u2019s delve a little deeper to grasp the import of what Shree Krishna is stating.The biggest dharma that the soul can engage in is devotion to God. That is what God strengthens by taking an Avat\u0101r. When God descends in the world, he reveals his divine forms, names, virtues, pastimes, abodes, and associates. This provides the souls with an easy basis for devotion. Since the mind needs a form to focus upon and to connect with, the formless aspect of God is very difficult to worship. On the other hand, devotion to the personal form of God is easy for people to comprehend, simple to perform, and sweet to engage in.Thus, since the descension of Lord Krishna 5,000 years ago, billions of souls have made his divine leelas (pastimes) as the basis of their devotion, and purified their minds with ease and joy. Similarly, the Ramayan has provided the souls with a popular basis for devotion for innumerable centuries. When the TV show, Ramayan, first began airing on Indian national television on Sunday mornings, all the streets of India would become empty. The pastimes of Lord Ram held such fascination for the people that they would be glued to their television sets to see the leelas on the screen. This reveals how Lord Ram\u2019s descension provided the basis for devotion to billions of souls in history. The Ramayan says:r\u0101m eka t\u0101pasa tiya t\u0101r\u012b, n\u0101ma ko\u1e6di khala kumati sudh\u0101r\u012b [v7]\u201cIn his descension period, Lord Ram helped only one Ahalya (Sage Gautam\u2019s wife, whom Lord Ram released from the body of stone). However, since then, by chanting the divine name \u201cRam,\u201d billions of fallen souls have elevated themselves.\u201d So a deeper understanding of this verse is:To establish dharma: God descends to establish the dharma of devotion by providing souls with his names, forms, pastimes, virtues, abodes, and associates, with the help of which they may engage in bhakti and purify their minds.To kill the wicked: Along with God, to help facilitate his divine pastimes, some liberated Saints descend and pretend to be miscreants. For example, Ravan and Kumbhakarna were Jaya and Vijaya who descended from the divine abode of God. They pretended to be demons and opposed and fought with Ram. They could not have been killed by anyone else, since they were divine personalities. So, God slayed such demons as a part of his leelas. And having killed them, he sent them to his divine abode, since that was where they came from in the first place.To protect the righteous: Many souls had become sufficiently elevated in their s\u0101dhan\u0101 (spiritual practice) to qualify to meet God face-to-face. When Shree Krishna descended in the world, these eligible souls got their first opportunity to participate in God\u2019s divine pastimes. For example, some gop\u012bs (cowherd women of Vrindavan, where Shree Krishna manifested his pastimes) were liberated souls who had descended from the divine abode to assist in Shree Krishna\u2019s leelas. Other gop\u012bs were materially bound souls who got their first chance to meet and serve God, and participate in his leelas. So when Shree Krishna descended in the world, such qualified souls got the opportunity to perfect their devotion by directly participating in the pastimes of God.This is the deeper meaning of the verse. However, it is not wrong if someone wishes to cognize the verse more literally or metaphorically."

        "commentary": "Understand this verse in the light of the previous one. Our mind gets cleansed by engaging it in devotional remembrance of God. This devotion can either be toward the formless aspect of God or toward his personal form. Devotion toward the formless is intangible and nebulous to most people. They find nothing to focus upon or feel connected with during such devotional meditation. Devotion to the personal form of God is tangible and simple. Such devotion requires divine sentiments toward the personality of God. For people to engage in devotion to Shree Krishna, they must develop divine feelings toward his names, form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates. For example, people purify their minds by worshipping stone deities because they harbor the divine sentiments that God resides in these deities. It is these sentiments that purify the devotee\u2019s mind. The progenitor Manu says:na k\u0101\u1e63h\u1e6dhe vidyate devo na \u015bhil\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 na m\u1e5bitsu chabh\u0101ve hi vidyate devastasm\u0101tbh\u0101va\u1e41 sam\u0101charet [v8]\u201cGod resides neither in wood nor in stone, but in a devotional heart. Hence, worship the deity with loving sentiments.\u201dSimilarly, if we wish to engage in devotion toward Lord Krishna, we must learn to harbor divine sentiments toward his leelas. Those commentators who give a figurative interpretation to the Mahabharat and the Bhagavad Gita, do grave injustice by destroying the basis of people\u2019s faith in devotion toward Shree Krishna. In this verse, Shree Krishna has emphasized the need for divine sentiments toward his pastimes, for enhancing our devotion.To develop such divine feelings, we must understand the difference between God\u2019s actions and ours. We materially bound souls have not yet attained divine bliss, and hence the longing of our soul is not yet satiated. Thus, our actions are motivated by self-interest and the desire for personal fulfillment. However, God\u2019s actions have no personal motive because he is perfectly satiated by the infinite bliss of his own personality. He does not need to achieve further personal bliss by performing actions. Therefore, whatever he does is for the welfare of the materially conditioned souls. Such divine actions that God performs are termed as \u201cleelas\u201d while the actions we perform are called \u201cwork.\u201dSimilarly, God\u2019s birth is also divine, and unlike ours, it does not take place from a mother\u2019s womb. The all-Blissful God has no requirement to hang upside down in a mother\u2019s womb. The Bh\u0101gavatam states:tam adbhuta\u1e41 b\u0101lakam ambujek\u1e63ha\u1e47a\u1e41chatur-bhuja\u1e41 \u015bha\u1e45kha gad\u0101dyud\u0101yudham(10.3.9) [v9]\u201cWhen Shree Krishna manifested upon birth before Vasudev and Devaki, he was in his four-armed Vishnu form.\u201d This full-sized form could definitely not have resided in Devaki\u2019s womb. However, to create in her the feeling that he was there, by his Yogmaya power, he simply kept expanding Devaki\u2019s womb. Finally, he manifested from the outside, revealing that he had never been inside her:\u0101vir\u0101s\u012bd yath\u0101 pr\u0101chy\u0101\u1e41 di\u015bh\u012bndur iva pu\u1e63hkala\u1e25(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.3.8) [v10]\u201cAs the moon manifests in its full glory in the night sky, similarly the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna manifested before Devaki and Vasudev.\u201d This is the divine nature of God\u2019s birth. If we can develop faith in the divinity of his pastimes and birth, then we will be able to easily engage in devotion to his personal form, and attain the supreme destination."

        "commentary": "In the previous verse, Lord Krishna explained that those who truly know the divine nature of his birth and pastimes attain him. He now confirms that legions of human beings in all ages became God-realized by this means. They achieved this goal by purifying their minds through devotion. Shree Aurobindo put it very nicely: \u201cYou must keep the temple of the heart clean, if you wish to install therein the living presence.\u201d The Bible states: \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\u201d (Matthew 5.8) [v11]Now, how does the mind get purified? By giving up attachment, fear, and anger, and absorbing the mind in God. Actually, attachment is the cause of both fear and anger. Fear arises out of apprehension that the object of our attachment will be snatched away from us. And anger arises when there is an obstruction in attaining the object of our attachment. Attachment is thus the root cause of the mind getting dirty.This world of Maya consists of the three modes of material nature\u2014sattva, rajas, and tamas (goodness, passion, and ignorance). All objects and personalities in the world come within the realm of these three modes. When we attach our mind to a material object or person, our mind too becomes affected by the three modes. Instead, when we absorb the same mind in God, who is beyond the three modes of material nature, such devotion purifies the mind. Thus, the sovereign recipe to cleanse the mind from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, and illusion, is to detach it from the world and attach it to the Supreme Lord. Hence, the Ramayan states:prema bhagati jala binu raghur\u0101\u012b, abhiantara mala kabahu\u00f1 na j\u0101\u012b\u201cWithout devotion to God, the dirt of the mind will not be washed away.\u201d Even the ardent propagator of j\u00f1\u0101na yog, Shankaracharya, stated:\u015bhuddhayati hi n\u0101ntar\u0101tm\u0101 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47apad\u0101mbhoja bhaktim\u1e5bite (Prabodh Sudh\u0101kar)[v13]\u201cWithout engaging in devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, the mind will not be cleansed.\u201dOn reading the previous verse, a question may arise whether Lord Krishna is partial in bestowing his grace upon those who absorb their minds in him versus the worldly-minded souls. The Supreme Lord addresses this in the next verse."

        "commentary": "Here, Lord Krishna states that he reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him. For those who deny the existence of God, he meets them in the form of the law of karma\u2014he sits inside their hearts, notes their actions, and dispenses the results. But such atheists too cannot get away from serving him; they are obliged to serve God\u2019s material energy, Maya, in its various apparitions, as wealth, luxuries, relatives, prestige, etc. Maya holds them under the sway of anger, lust, and greed. On the other hand, for those who turn their mind away from worldly attractions and look upon God as the goal and refuge, he takes care of them just as a mother takes care of her child.Shree Krishna uses the word bhaj\u0101mi, which means \u201cto serve.\u201d He serves the surrendered souls, by destroying their accumulated karmas of endless lifetimes, cutting the bonds of Maya, removing the darkness of material existence, and bestowing divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. And when the devotee learns to love God selflessly, he willingly enslaves himself to their love. Shree Ram thus tells Hanuman:ekaikasyopak\u0101rasya pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101n d\u0101sy\u0101mi te kape\u015bhe\u1e63hasyehopak\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 bhav\u0101m \u1e5bi\u1e47ino vaya\u1e41(V\u0101lm\u012bki Ramayan)[v14]\u201cO Hanuman, to release myself from the debt of one service you performed for me, I shall have to offer my life to you. For all the other devotional services done by you, I shall remain eternally indebted.\u201d In this way, God reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.If God is so merciful upon his devotees, why do some people worship the celestial gods instead?

The boons the celestial gods bestow are material and temporary, and they are given only by virtue of the power they have received from the Supreme Lord. There is a beautiful instructive story in this regard:Saint Farid went to the court of Emperor Akbar, a powerful king in Indian history. He waited in the court for an audience, while Akbar was praying in the next room. Farid peeped into the room to see what was going on, and was amused to hear Akbar praying to God for more powerful army, a bigger treasure chest, and success in battle. Without disturbing the king, Farid returned to the royal court.After completing his prayers, Akbar came and gave him audience. He asked the great Sage if there was anything that he wanted. Farid replied, \u201cI came to ask the Emperor for things I required for my \u0101\u015bhram. However, I find that the Emperor is himself a beggar before the Lord. Then why should I ask him for any favors, and not directly from the Lord himself?\u201dThe celestial gods give boons only by the powers bestowed upon them by the Supreme Lord. People with small understanding approach them, but those who are intelligent realize that there is no point in going to the intermediary and they approach the Supreme Lord for the fulfillment of their aspirations. People are of various kinds, possessing higher and lower aspirations. Shree Krishna now mentions four categories of qualities and works."

        "commentary": "The Vedas classify people into four categories of occupations, not according to their birth, but according to their natures. Such varieties of occupations exist in every society. Even in communist nations where equality is the overriding principle, the diversity in human beings cannot be smothered. There are the philosophers who are the communist party think-tanks, there are the military men who protect the country, there are the farmers who engage in agriculture, and there are the factory workers.The Vedic philosophy explains this variety in a more scientific manner. It states that the material energy is constituted of three gu\u1e47as (modes): sattva gu\u1e47a (mode of goodness), rajo gu\u1e47a (mode of passion), and tamo gu\u1e47a (mode of ignorance). The Brahmins are those who have a preponderance of the mode of goodness. They are predisposed toward teaching and worship. The Kshatriyas are those who have a preponderance of the mode of passion mixed with a smaller amount of the mode of goodness. They are inclined toward administration and management. The Vaishyas are those who possess the mode of passion mixed with some mode of ignorance. Accordingly, they form the business and agricultural class. Then there are the Shudras, who are predominated by the mode of ignorance. They form the working class. This classification was neither meant to be according to birth, nor was it unchangeable. Shree Krishna explains in this verse that the classification of the Var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system was according to people\u2019s qualities and activities.Although God is the creator of the scheme of the world, yet he is the non-doer. This is similar to the rain. Just as rain water falls equally on the forest, yet from some seeds huge banyan trees sprout, from other seeds beautiful flowers bloom, and from some thorny bushes emerge. The rain, which is impartial, is not answerable for this difference. In the same way, God provides the souls with the energy to act, but they are free in determining what they wish to do with it; God is not responsible for their actions."

The Ramayan states:samaratha kahu\u00f1 nahi\u1e45 do\u1e63hu gos\u0101\u012b\u1e45, rabi p\u0101vaka surasari k\u012b n\u0101\u012b\u1e45. [v15]\u201cPure personalities are never tainted by defects even in contact with impure situations and entities, like the sun, the fire, and the Ganges.\u201d The sun does not get tainted if sunlight falls on a puddle of urine. The sun retains its purity, while also purifying the dirty puddle. Similarly, if we offer impure objects into the fire, it still retains its purity\u2014the fire is pure, and whatever we pour into it also gets purified. In the same manner, numerous gutters of rainwater merge into the holy Ganges, but this does not make the Ganges a gutter\u2014the Ganges is pure and in transforms all those dirty gutters into the holy Ganges. Likewise, God is not tainted by the activities he performs.Activities bind one in karmic reactions when they are performed with the mentality of enjoying the results. However, God\u2019s actions are not motivated by selfishness; his every act is driven by compassion for the souls. Therefore, although he administers the world directly or indirectly, and engages in all kinds of activities in the process, he is never tainted by any reactions. Lord Krishna states here that he is transcendental to the fruitive reactions of work.Even Saints who are situated in God-consciousness become transcendental to the material energy. Since all their activities are effectuated in love for God, such pure-hearted Saints are not bound by the fruitive reactions of work. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:yat p\u0101da pa\u1e45kaja par\u0101ga ni\u1e63heva t\u1e5bipt\u0101yoga prabh\u0101va vidhut\u0101khila karma bandh\u0101\u1e25svaira\u1e41 charanti munayo \u2019pi na nahyam\u0101n\u0101stasyechchhay\u0101tta vapu\u1e63ha\u1e25 kuta eva bandha\u1e25(10.33.35) [v16]\u201cMaterial activities never taint the devotees of God who are fully satisfied in serving the dust of his lotus feet. Nor do material activities taint those wise sages who have freed themselves from the bondage of fruitive reactions by the power of Yog. So where is the question of bondage for the Lord himself who assumes his transcendental form according to his own sweet will?\u201d"

The reason is that they wish to serve God, and are inspired to do works for his pleasure. The knowledge of the previous verse assures them that they themselves will never be bound by welfare work that is done in the spirit of devotion. They are also moved by compassion on seeing the sufferings of the materially bound souls who are bereft of God consciousness, and are inspired to work for their spiritual elevation. The Buddha once said, \u201cAfter attaining enlightenment, you have two options\u2014either you do nothing, or you help others attain enlightenment.\u201dThus, even sages who have no selfish motive for work still engage in activities for the pleasure of God. Working in devotion also attracts the grace of God. Shree Krishna is advising Arjun to do the same.  Having asked Arjun to perform actions that do not bind one, the Lord now begins expounding the philosophy of action."

There is another kind of inaction performed by karm yogis. They execute their social duties without attachment to results, dedicating the fruits of their actions to God. Although engaged in all kinds of activities, they are not entangled in karmic reactions, since they have no motive for personal enjoyment. There were many great kings in Indian history\u2014Dhruv, Prahlad, Yudhisthir, Prithu, and Ambarish\u2014who discharged their kingly duties to the best of their abilities, and yet because their minds were not entangled in material desires, their actions were termed Akarm, or inaction.

It then strives to perform every action for the pleasure of God. \u201cWhatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire, whatever you bestow as a gift, and whatever austerities you perform, O son of Kunti, do them as an offering to me.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 9.27) Since such an enlightened soul renounces selfish actions for material pleasures and dedicates all actions to God, the works performed produce no karmic reactions.

The minds of enlightened persons are absorbed in God. Being fully satisfied in devotional union with him, they look upon God as their only refuge and do not depend upon external supports. In this state of mind, all their actions are termed as akarm, or inactions.There is a beautiful story in the Puranas to illustrate this point. The gop\u012bs (cowherd women) of Vrindavan once kept a fast. The ceremony of breaking the fast required them to feed a sage. Shree Krishna advised them to feed Sage Durvasa, the elevated ascetic, who lived on the other side of River Yamuna. The gop\u012bs prepared a delicious feast and started off, but found the river was very turbulent that day, and no boatman was willing to ferry them across.The gop\u012bs asked Shree Krishna for a solution.

Nevertheless, when they requested River Yamuna in that manner, the river gave them way and a bridge of flowers manifested for their passage across.The gop\u012bs were astonished. They went across to the \u0101\u015bhram of Sage Durvasa. They requested him to accept the delicious meal they had brought for him. Being an ascetic, he ate only a small portion, which disappointed the gop\u012bs. So, Durvasa decided to fulfill their expectations, and using his mystic powers, he ate everything they had brought. The gop\u012bs were amazed to see him eat so much, but were very pleased that he had done justice to their cooking.The gop\u012bs now asked Durvasa for help to cross the Yamuna and return to the other side. He replied, \u201cTell River Yamuna that if Durvasa has not eaten anything today except doob (a kind of grass which was the only thing Durvasa used to eat), the river should give way.\u201d The gop\u012bs again started laughing, for they had seen him eat such an extravagant meal. Yet to their utmost surprise, when they beseeched River Yamuna in that manner, the river again gave them way.The gop\u012bs asked Shree Krishna the secret behind what had happened. He explained that while God and the Saints appear to engage in material activities externally, internally they are always transcendentally situated. Thus, even while doing all kinds of actions, they are still considered to be non-doers. Although interacting with the gop\u012bs externally, Shree Krishna was an akha\u1e47\u1e0d brahmachar\u012b internally. And though Durvasa ate the delectable meal offered by the gop\u012bs, internally his mind only tasted the doob grass. Both these were illustrations of inaction in action."

If one is driving a car in the correct lane, at the correct speed, with eyes fixed ahead, and someone suddenly comes and falls in front of the car and dies as a result, the court of law will not consider it as a culpable offence, provided it can be proved that the person had no intention to maim or kill. It is the intention of the mind that is of primary importance, and not the action. Similarly, the mystics who work in divine consciousness are released from all sins, because their mind is free from attachment and proprietorship, and their every act is performed with the divine intention of pleasing God."

Life too brings its share of dualities\u2014happiness and distress, victory and defeat, fame and notoriety. Lord Ram himself, in his divine pastimes, was exiled to the forest the day before he was to be crowned as the king of Ayodhya.While living in this world, nobody can hope to neutralize the dualities to have only positive experiences. Then how can we successfully deal with the dualities that come our way in life? The solution is to take these dualities in stride, by learning to rise above them in equipoise in all situations. This happens when we develop detachment to the fruits of our actions, concerning ourselves merely with doing our duty in life without yearning for the results. When we perform works for the pleasure of God, we see both positive and negative fruits of those works as the will of God, and joyfully accept both."

For example, light is the energy of fire. It can be considered as different from the fire, because it exists outside it. But it can also be reckoned as a part of the fire itself. Hence, when the rays of the sun enter the room through a window, people say, \u201cThe sun has come.\u201d Here, they are bundling the sunrays with the sun. The energy is both distinct from the energetic and yet a part of it.The soul too is the energy of God\u2014it is a spiritual energy, called j\u012bva \u015bhakti.

This has been stated in Bhagavad Gita, Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47, etc.\u201d Thus, the soul is also simultaneously one with and different from God. Hence, those whose minds are fully absorbed in God-consciousness see the whole world in its unity with God as non-different from him.

However, people vary in their understanding, and hence perform sacrifice in different manners with dissimilar consciousness. Persons with lesser understanding, and wanting material rewards, make offerings to the celestial gods.Others with deeper understanding of the meaning of yaj\u00f1a offer their own selves as sacrifice to the Supreme. This is called \u0101tma samarpa\u1e47, or \u0101tm\u0101hut\u012b, or offering one\u2019s soul to God. Yogi Shri Krishna Prem explained this very well: \u201cIn this world of dust and din, whenever one makes \u0101tm\u0101hut\u012b in the flame of divine love, there is an explosion, which is grace, for no true \u0101tm\u0101hut\u012b can ever go in vain.\u201d But what is the process of offering one\u2019s own self as sacrifice?

        "commentary": "Fire transforms the nature of things consigned into it. In external ritualistic Vedic sacrifices, it physically consumes oblations offered to it. In the internal practice of spirituality, fire is symbolic. The fire of self-discipline burns the desires of the senses.\nHere, Shree Krishna distinguishes between two diametrically opposite approaches to spiritual elevation. One is the path of negation of the senses, which is followed in the practice of ha\u1e6dha yog. In this type of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), the actions of the senses are suspended, except for the bare maintenance of the body. The mind is completely withdrawn from the senses and made introvertive, by force of will-power.\nOpposite to this is the practice of bhakti yog. In this second type of yaj\u00f1a, the senses are made to behold the glory of the Creator that manifests in every atom of his creation. The senses no longer remain as instruments for material enjoyment; rather they are sublimated to perceive God in everything. In verse 7.8, Shree Krishna says: raso \u2018ham apsu kaunteya \u201cArjun, know me to be the taste in water.\u201d Accordingly, bhakti yogis practice to behold God through all their senses, in everything they see, hear, taste, feel, and smell. This yaj\u00f1a of devotion is simpler than the path of ha\u1e6dha yog; it is joyous to perform, and involves a smaller risk of downfall from the path. If one is riding a bicycle and presses the brakes to stop the forward motion, he will be in an unstable condition, but if the cyclist simply turns the handle to the left or right, the bicycle will very easily stop its forward motion and still remain stably balanced."

While ha\u1e6dha yogis strive to restrain the senses with brute will-power, j\u00f1\u0101na yogis accomplish the same goal with the repeated practice of discrimination based on knowledge. They engage in deep contemplation upon the illusory nature of the world, and the identity of the self as distinct from the body, mind, intellect, and ego. The senses are withdrawn from the world, and the mind is engaged in meditation upon the self. The goal is to become practically situated in self-knowledge, in the assumption that the self is identical with the Supreme Ultimate reality. As aids to contemplation, they chant aphorisms such as: tattvamasi \u201cI am That,\u201d (Chh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63had 6.8.7)[v21] and aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi \u201cI am the Supreme Entity.\u201d (B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had 1.4.10) [v22]The practice of j\u00f1\u0101na yog is a very difficult path, which requires a very determined and trained intellect.

Shree Krishna brings Arjun to the understanding that sacrifices can take on hundreds of forms, but when they are dedicated to God, they become means of purification of the mind and senses and elevation of the soul. In this verse, he mentions three such yaj\u00f1as that can be performed.Dravya yaj\u00f1a. There are those who are inclined toward earning wealth and donating it in charity toward a divine cause. Although they may engage in large and complicated business endeavors, yet their inner motivation remains to serve God with the wealth they earn. In this manner, they offer their propensity for earning money as sacrifice to God in devotion. John Wesley, the British preacher and founder of the Methodist Church would instruct his followers: \u201cMake all you can. Save all you can. Give all you can.\u201dYog yaj\u00f1a. In Indian philosophy the Yog Dar\u015bhan is one of the six philosophical treatises written by six learned sages.

Some people find this path attractive and practice it as sacrifice. However, Pata\u00f1jali Yog Dar\u015bhan clearly states:sam\u0101dhisiddhir\u012b\u015bhvara pra\u1e47idh\u0101n\u0101t (2.45)[v24]\u201cTo attain perfection in Yog, you must surrender to God.\u201d So when persons inclined toward a\u1e63h\u1e6dang yog learn to love God, they offer their yogic practice as yaj\u00f1a in the fire of devotion. An example of this is the yogic system \u201cJagadguru Kripaluji Yog,\u201d where the physical postures of a\u1e63h\u1e6da\u1e45g yog are practiced as yaj\u00f1a to God, along with the chanting of his divine names. Such a combination of yogic postures along with devotion results in the physical, mental, and spiritual purification of the practitioner.J\u00f1\u0101na yaj\u00f1a. Some persons are inclined toward the cultivation of knowledge. This propensity finds its perfect employment in the study of scriptures for enhancing one\u2019s understanding and love for God. s\u0101 vidy\u0101 tanmatiryay\u0101 (Bh\u0101gavatam 4.29.49)[v25] \u201cTrue knowledge is that which increases our devotion to God.\u201d Thus, studiously inclined s\u0101dhaks engage in the sacrifice of knowledge, which when imbued with the spirit of devotion, leads to loving union with God."

For example, devotees of the Lord partake of food after offering it to him. After cooking the food, they place it on the altar and pray to God to accept their offering. In their mind, they meditate on the sentiment that God is actually eating from the plate. At the end of the offering, the remnants on the plate are accepted as pras\u0101d, or the grace of God. Partaking of such nectar-like pras\u0101d leads to illumination, purification, and spiritual advancement.In the same mood, devotees offer clothes to God and then wear them as his pras\u0101d. They install his deity in their house, and then live in it with the attitude that their home is the temple of God. When objects or activities are offered as sacrifice to God, then the remnants, or pras\u0101d, are a nectar-like blessing for the soul.

Ritualistic ceremonies, fasts, mantra chants, holy pilgrimages, are all fine, but if they are not performed with knowledge, they remain mere physical activities. Such mechanical activities are better than not doing anything at all, but they are not sufficient to purify the mind.Many people chant God\u2019s name on rosary beads, sit in recitations of the scriptures, visit holy places, and perform worship ceremonies, with the belief that the physical act itself is sufficient for liberating them from material bondage. However, Saint Kabir rejects this idea very eloquently:m\u0101l\u0101 pherata yuga phir\u0101, phir\u0101 na mana k\u0101 pher,kar k\u0101 manak\u0101 \u1e0d\u0101ri ke, manak\u0101 manak\u0101 pher [v27]\u201cO spiritual aspirant, you have been rotating the chanting beads for many ages, but the mischief of the mind has not ceased.

Whatever form of devotion you do, engage your mind in meditating upon God.\u201dDevotional sentiments are nourished by the cultivation of knowledge. For example, let us say that it is your birthday party, and people are coming and handing you gifts. Someone comes and gives you a ragged bag. You look at it disdainfully, thinking it is insignificant in comparison to the other wonderful gifts you have received. That person requests you to look inside the bag. You open it and find a stack of one hundred notes of $100 denomination. You immediately hug the bag to your chest, and say, \u201cThis is the best gift I have received.\u201d Knowledge of its contents developed love for the object. Similarly, cultivating knowledge of God and our relationship with him nurtures devotional sentiments.

He will then bring you great happiness by bestowing knowledge of the scriptures and discrimination.\u201d Jagadguru Shankaracharya stated: y\u0101vat gururna kartavyo t\u0101vanmuktirna labhyate[v32] \u201cUntil you surrender to a Guru you cannot be liberated from the material energy.\u201dOne of the most magnanimous graces of God is when he brings the soul in contact with a true Guru. But the process of transfer of spiritual knowledge from the teacher to the student is very different from that of material knowledge. Secular education does not require deep respect for the teacher. The transmission of knowledge can be purchased simply by paying the teacher\u2019s fees. However, spiritual edification is not imparted to the student by a mechanical teaching process, nor is it purchased for a price. It is revealed in the heart of the disciple by the Guru\u2019s grace, when the disciple develops humility, and the Guru is pleased with the service attitude of the disciple. That is why Prahlad Maharaj said:nai\u1e63h\u0101\u1e41 matis t\u0101vad urukram\u0101\u1e45ghri\u1e41 sp\u1e5bi\u015bhatyanarth\u0101pagamo yadartha\u1e25mah\u012byas\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101da rajo \u2019bhi\u1e63heka\u1e41 ni\u1e63hki\u00f1chan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 na v\u1e5bi\u1e47\u012bta y\u0101vat(Bh\u0101gavatam 7.5.32)[v33]\u201cUntil we bathe ourselves in the dust of the lotus feet of a Saint, we can never have an experience of the transcendental platform.\u201d Hence, in this verse Shree Krishna mentions the need for approaching a Guru with reverence, inquiring about the Truth from him with humility, and pleasing him by rendering service."

In this state of material bondage, there is no respite for the soul, and endless lifetimes have gone by being subjected to these conditions. Like a football being kicked around the field, the soul is elevated to the celestial abodes, dropped to the hellish planes of existence, and brought back to the earthly realm, etc. according to its karmas of righteous or sinful deeds.Divine knowledge provides the boat to cross over the material ocean. The ignorant perform karmas and get bound by them. Performing the same karmas as a yaj\u00f1a to God liberates the knowledgeable. Thus, knowledge becomes the means of cutting material bondage.

In 1666, the Great Fire of London began as only a little flame in a small bakery, but as it grew it consigned to flames 13,200 houses, 87 churches, and most of the city offices.\nWe too have a heap of karmas attached to each of us, consisting of the reactions of the sinful and righteous deeds performed by us over infinite lifetimes. If we endeavor to exhaust these karmas by reaping their results, it will take many more lifetimes, and in the meantime further karmas will accumulate in an endless process. But Shree Krishna assures Arjun that knowledge has the power to burn our heap of karmas in this lifetime itself. That is because knowledge of the soul and its relationship with God leads us to surrender to him. When we surrender to God, he burns our stockpile of endless lifetimes of karmas and releases us from material bondage."

But a distinction needs to be made between two kinds of knowledge\u2014theoretical information and practical realization.\nThere is one kind of knowledge that is acquired by reading the scriptures and hearing from the Guru. This theoretical information is insufficient by itself. It is just as if someone has memorized a cookbook but has never entered the kitchen. Such theoretical knowledge of cooking does not help in satiating one\u2019s hunger. Similarly, one may acquire theoretical knowledge on the topics of the soul, God, Maya, karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, and bhakti from the Guru, but that by itself does not make a person God-realized. When one practices s\u0101dhan\u0101 in accordance with the theory, it results in purification of the mind. Then, from within one gets realization of the nature of the self and its relationship with God.

Not all spiritual truths are immediately perceptible; some of them can only be experienced after having attained sufficient elevation on the path. If we only accept what we can presently verify or comprehend, we will be bereft of the higher spiritual secrets. Faith helps us accept what we cannot understand at present. Jagadguru Shankaracharya has defined faith as follows:guru ved\u0101nta v\u0101kye\u1e63hu d\u1e5bi\u1e0dho vi\u015bhv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bhraddh\u0101 [v37]\u201cFaith means firm confidence in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.\u201d When such faith is placed upon a wrong personality, it can lead to disastrous consequences. But when it is placed on the true Guru, it opens the pathway for eternal welfare.However, blind faith is not a desirable thing. Before placing it on any Guru, we must use our intellect to confirm that the Guru has realized the Absolute Truth, and he is teaching it in accordance with the eternal Vedic scriptures. Once this is confirmed, then we should strive to deepen our faith in such a Guru, and surrender to God under his guidance.

The medium class s\u0101dhak is one who does not have knowledge of the scriptures, but is endowed with faith toward God and Guru. The lowest class s\u0101dhak is one, who neither has scriptural knowledge nor is endowed with faith.\u201d For the third category, Shree Krishna says that such persons cannot attain peace either in this life or hereafter.\nEven worldly activities require the exercise of faith. For example, if a woman goes to a restaurant and places an order for the meal, she has faith that the restaurant will not mix poison in her food. If, however, she is besieged with doubts and wants to subject every food item to a chemical test first, how will she ever enjoy and finish her meal? Similarly, a man goes to barber shop to get a shave, and sits on the chair while the barber moves the sharp edge of his knife over his throat. Now, if the man doubts the barber and suspects his having the intention of murder, he will not be able to sit still for the barber to be able to shave him. Hence, Shree Krishna says in this verse that for the doubting person there is no happiness either in this world or in the next."

If we multiply 0 with 10, the result will be 0; if we multiply 0 with 1000, the result will remain 0; and if we multiply 0 with 1 million, the result will still be 0. Similarly, the works that enlightened souls perform in the world do not bind them, because they are offered to God in the fire of Yog, i.e. they are done for the pleasure of God.

That is the reason why in love and hatred one experiences pain in the heart. In this sense, the heart is the source of compassion, love, sympathy, and all the good emotions. So when Shree Krishna mentions doubts that have arisen in the heart, he means doubts that have arisen in the mind, which is the subtle machine that resides in the region of the heart.\nIn the role of being the Spiritual Master of Arjun, the Lord has imparted to his disciple the knowledge of how to gain insightful wisdom from the practice of karm yog. He now advises Arjun to utilize both wisdom and faith to cleave out the doubts from his mind. Then, he gives the call of action and asks Arjun to rise up and do his duty in the spirit of karm yog. The dual instructions to both refrain from action and to engage in action still create confusion in Arjun\u2019s mind, which he reveals in the opening of the next chapter."

        "commentary": "Living in a cave in the Himalayas, a yogi may feel that he has renounced, but the test of that renunciation comes when he returns to the city.\u00a0 For instance, one sadhu practiced austerities for twelve years in the mountains of Garhwal.\u00a0 He came down to Haridwar to participate in the holy fair called Kumbh Mel\u0101.\u00a0 In the hustle and bustle of the fair, someone accidentally placed his shoe on the sadhu\u2019s bare foot.\u00a0 The sadhu \u00a0was infuriated, and screamed, \u201cAre you blind?\u00a0 Can you not see where you are going?\u201d\u00a0 Later he repented for permitting anger to overcome him, and lamented, \u201cTwelve years of austerities in the mountains got washed away by living one day in the city!\u201d\u00a0 The world is the arena where our renunciation gets tested.In this verse, Shree Krishna says that while performing one\u2019s duties in the world, a person should slowly learn to rise above anger, greed, and desire.\u00a0 Instead, if one first gives up duties, it is very difficult to purify the mind; and without a pure mind, true detachment remains a distant dream.\u00a0We are all propelled to work by our nature.\u00a0 Arjun was a warrior, and if he had artificially renounced his duty, to retire to the forest, his nature would make him work there as well.\u00a0 He would probably gather a few tribesmen and declare himself their king.\u00a0 Instead, it would be more fruitful to use his natural inclinations and talents in the service of God.\u00a0 So the Lord instructs him, \u201cContinue to fight, but make one change.\u00a0 At first, you came to this battleground on the presumption of saving a kingdom.\u00a0 Now, instead, simply dedicate your service unselfishly to God.\u00a0 In this way, you will naturally purify the mind and achieve true renunciation from within.\u201d\u00a0A tender and unripe fruit clings fast to the tree that bears and nourishes it.\u00a0 But the same fruit, when fully ripe, severs its connection from its sustainer.\u00a0 Similarly from the material existence, the karm yogi gets the experience that matures into wisdom.\u00a0 Just as sound sleep is only possible for those who have worked hard, deep meditation comes to those who have purified their minds through karm-yog."

        "commentary": "The ritualistic activities described in the Vedas include fire sacrifices, such as Agnihotra yajna. The rules for those who enter the renounced order of sany\u0101s state that they should not perform the ritualistic karm k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d activities; in fact they should not touch fire at all, not even for the purpose of cooking. And they should subsist on alms instead. However, Shree Krishna states in this verse that merely giving up the sacrificial fire does not make one a sany\u0101s\u012b (renunciant).Who are true yogis, and who are true sany\u0101s\u012bs? There is much confusion in this regard. People say, \u201cThis swamiji is phal\u0101h\u0101r\u012b (one who eats only fruits and nothing else), and so he must be an elevated yogi.\u201d \u201cThis b\u0101b\u0101j\u012b (renunciant) is d\u016bdh\u0101h\u0101r\u012b (subsists on milk alone), and hence he must be an even higher yogi.\u201d \u201cThis guruji is pavan\u0101h\u0101r\u012b (does not eat, lives only on the breath), and so he must definitely be God-realized.\u201d \u201cThis sadhu is a n\u0101g\u0101 b\u0101b\u0101 (ascetic who does not wear clothes), and thus he is perfectly renounced.\u201d However, Shree Krishna dismisses all these concepts. He says that such external acts of asceticism do not make anyone either a sany\u0101s\u012b or a yogi. Those who can renounce the fruits of their actions, by offering them to God, are the true renunciants and yogis.Nowadays Yoga has become the buzz word in the western world. Numerous Yoga studios have sprung up in every town of every country of the world. Statistics reveal that one out of every ten persons in America is practicing Yoga. But this word \u201cYoga\u201d does not exist in the Sanskrit scriptures. The actual word is \u201cYog,\u201d which means \u201cunion.\u201d It refers to the union of the individual consciousness with the divine consciousness. In other words, a yogi is one whose mind is fully absorbed in God. It also follows that such a yogi\u2019s mind is naturally detached from the world. Hence, the true yogi is also the true sany\u0101s\u012b.Persons who perform karm yog do all activities in the spirit of humble service to God without any desire whatsoever for rewards. Even though they may be g\u1e5bihasthas (living with a family), such persons are true yogis and the real renunciants."

        "commentary": "A sany\u0101s\u012b is one who renounces the pleasures of the mind and senses. But mere renunciation is not the goal, nor is it sufficient to reach the goal. Renunciation means that our running in the wrong direction has stopped. We were searching for happiness in the world, and we understood that there is no happiness in material pleasures, so we stopped running toward the world. But, the destination is not reached just by stopping. The destination of the soul is God-realization. The process of going toward God\u2014taking the mind toward him\u2014is the path of Yog. Those who have incomplete knowledge of the goal of life, look upon renunciation as the highest goal of spirituality. Those who truly understand the goal of life, regard God-realization as the ultimate goal of their spiritual endeavor.\nIn the purport to verse 5.4, it was explained that there are two kinds of renunciation\u2014phalgu vair\u0101gya and yukt vair\u0101gya. Phalgu vair\u0101gya is that where worldly objects are seen as objects of Maya, the material energy, and hence renounced because they are detrimental to spiritual progress. Yukt vair\u0101gya is that where everything is seen as belonging to God, and hence meant to be utilized in his service. In the first kind of renunciation, one would say, \u201cGive up money. Do not touch it. It is a form of Maya, and it impedes the path of spirituality.\u201d In the second kind of renunciation, one would say, \u201cMoney is also a form of the energy of God. Do not waste it or throw it away; utilize whatever you have in your possession for the service of God.\u201d\nPhalgu vair\u0101gya is unstable, and can easily revert to attachment for the world. The name \u201cPhalgu\u201d comes from a river in the city of Gaya, in the state of Bihar in India. The river Phalgu runs below the surface. From atop, it seems as if there is no water, but if you dig a few feet, you encounter the stream below. Similarly, many persons renounce the world to go and live in monasteries, only to find that in a few years the renunciation has vanished and the mind is again attached to the world. Their detachment was phalgu vair\u0101gya. Finding the world to be troublesome and miserable, they desired to get away from it by taking shelter in monastery. But when they found spiritual life also to be difficult and arduous, they got detached from spirituality as well. Then there are others who establish their loving relationship with God. Motivated by the desire to serve him, they renounce the world to live in a monastery. Their renunciation is yukt vair\u0101gya. They usually continue the journey even if they face difficulties.\nIn the first line of this verse, Shree Krishna states that a real sany\u0101s\u012b (renunciant) is one who is a yogi, i.e. one who is uniting the mind with God in loving service. In the second line, Shree Krishna states that one cannot be a yogi without giving up material desires. If there are material desires in the mind, then it will naturally run toward the world. Since it is the mind that has to be united with God, this is only possible if the mind is free from all material desires. Thus, to be a yogi one has to be a sany\u0101s\u012b from within; and one can only be a sany\u0101s\u012b if one is a yogi."

        "commentary": "In chapter 3, verse 3, Shree Krishna mentioned that there are two paths for attaining welfare\u2014the path of contemplation and the path of action. Between these, he recommended to Arjun to follow the path of action. Again in chapter 5, verse 2, he declared it to be the better path. Does this mean that we must keep doing work all our life? Anticipating such a question, Shree Krishna sets the limits for it. When we perform karm yog, it leads to the purification of the mind and the ripening of spiritual knowledge. But once the mind has been purified and we advance in Yog, then we can leave karm yog and take to karm sany\u0101s. Material activities now serve no purpose and meditation now becomes the means.\nSo the path we must follow filters down to a matter of our eligibility and Shree Krishna explains the criteria of eligibility in this verse. He says that for those who are aspiring for Yog, the path of karm yog is more suitable; and those who are elevated in Yog, the path of karm sany\u0101s is more suitable.\nThe word Yog refers to both the goal and the process to reach the goal. When we talk of it as being the goal, we use Yog as meaning \u201cunion with God.\u201d And when we talk of it as being the process, we use Yog as meaning the \u201cpath\u201d to union with God.\nIn this second context, Yog is like a ladder we climb to reach God. At the lowest rung, the soul is caught in worldliness, with the consciousness absorbed in mundane matter. The ladder of Yog takes the soul from that level to the stage where the consciousness is absorbed in the divine. The various rungs of the ladder have different names, but Yog is a term common to them all. Yog-\u0101ruruk\u1e63hu are those s\u0101dhaks who aspire for union with God and have just begun climbing the ladder. Yog-\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha are those who have become elevated on the ladder.\nSo, how do we understand when one is elevated in the science of Yog? Shree Krishna explains this next."

So an easy criterion of evaluating the state of one\u2019s mind is to check whether it has become free from all material desires. A person will be considered detached from the world when one no longer craves for sense objects nor is inclined to perform any actions for attaining them. Such a person ceases to look for opportunities to create circumstances to enjoy sensual pleasures, eventually extinguishes all thoughts of enjoying sense objects, and also dissolves the memories of previous enjoyments.The mind now no longer gushes into self-centered activities at the urge of the senses. When we achieve this level of mastery over the mind, we will be considered elevated in Yog."

        "commentary": "We are responsible for our own elevation or debasement. Nobody can traverse the path of God-realization for us. Saints and Gurus show us the way, but we have to travel it ourselves. There is a saying in Hindi: ek pe\u1e0da do pak\u1e63h\u012b bai\u1e6dhe, ek guru ek chel\u0101, apan\u012b karan\u012b guru utare, apan\u012b karan\u012b chel\u0101[v.01] \u201cThere are two birds sitting on a tree\u2014one Guru and one disciple. The Guru will descend by his own works, and the disciple will also only be able to climb down by his own karmas.\u201d\nWe have had innumerable lifetimes before this one, and God-realized Saints were always present on Earth. At any period of time, if the world is devoid of such Saints, then the souls of that period cannot become God-realized. How then can they fulfill the purpose of human life, which is God-realization? Thus, God ensures that God-realized Saints are always present in every era, to guide the sincere seekers and inspire humanity. So, in infinite past lifetimes, many times we must have met God-realized Saints and yet we did not become God-realized. This means that the problem was not lack of proper guidance, but either our reticence in accepting it or working according to it. Thus, we must first accept responsibility for our present level of spirituality, or lack thereof. Only then will we gain the confidence that if we have brought ourselves to our present state, we can also elevate ourselves by our efforts.\nWhen we suffer reversals on the path of spiritual growth, we tend to complain that others have caused havoc to us, and they are our enemies. However, our biggest enemy is our own mind. It is the saboteur that thwarts our aspirations for perfection. Shree Krishna states that, on the one hand, as the greatest benefactor of the soul, the mind has the potential of giving us the most benefit; on the other hand, as our greatest adversary, it also has the potential for causing the maximum harm. A controlled mind can accomplish many beneficial endeavors, whereas an uncontrolled mind can degrade the consciousness with most ignoble thoughts.\nIn order to be able to use it as a friend, it is important to understand the mind\u2019s nature. Our mind operates at four levels:\nMind: When it creates thoughts, we call it mana, or the mind.\nIntellect: When it analyses and decides, we call it buddhi, or intellect.\nChitta: When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it chitta.\nEgo: When it identifies with the bodily identifications and becomes proud of things like wealth, status, beauty, and learning, we call it ahank\u0101r, or ego.\nThese are not four separate entities. They are simply four levels of functioning of the one mind. Hence, we may refer to them all together as the mind, or as the mind-intellect, or as the mind-intellect-ego, or as the mind-intellect-chitta-ego. They all refer to the same thing.\nThe use of the word ego here is different from its connotation in Freudian psychology. Sigmund Freud (1856 \u2013 1939), an Austrian neurologist, proposed the first theory of psychology regarding how the mind works. According to him, the ego is the \u201creal self\u201d that bridges the gap between our untamed desires (Id) and the value system that is learnt during childhood (Superego).\nVarious scriptures describe the mind in one of these four ways for the purpose of explaining the concepts presented there. They are all referring to the same internal apparatus within us, which is together called anta\u1e25 kara\u1e47, or the mind. For example:\nThe Pa\u00f1chada\u015bh\u012b refers to all four together as the mind, and states that it is the cause of material bondage.\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly talks of the mind and the intellect as being two things, and emphasizes the need to surrender both to God.\nThe Yog Dar\u015bhan, while analyzing the different elements of nature, talks of three entities: mind, intellect, and ego.\nShankaracharya, while explaining the apparatus available to the soul, classifies the mind into four\u2014mind, intellect, chitta and ego.\nSo when Shree Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self, he means we must use the higher mind to elevate the lower mind. In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind. How this can be done has been explained in detail in verses 2.41 to 2.44 and again in verse 3.43."

        "commentary": "We dissipate a large portion of our thought power and energy in combating people whom we perceive as enemies and potentially harmful to us. The Vedic scriptures say the biggest enemies\u2014lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, etc.\u2014reside in our own mind. These internal enemies are even more pernicious than the outer ones. The external demons may injure us for some time, but the demons sitting within our own mind have the ability to make us live in constant wretchedness. We all know people who had everything favorable in the world, but lived miserable lives because their own mind tormented them incessantly through depression, hatred, tension, anxiety, and stress. The Vedic philosophy lays great emphasis on the ramification of thoughts. Illness is not only caused by viruses and bacteria, but also by the negativities we harbor in the mind. If someone accidentally throws a stone at you, it may hurt for a few minutes, but by the next day, you will probably have forgotten about it. However, if someone says something unpleasant, it may continue to agitate your mind for years. This is the immense power of the thoughts. In the Buddhist scripture, the Dhammapada (1.3), the Buddha also expresses this truth vividly: \u201cI have been insulted! I have been hurt! I have been beaten! I have been robbed! Misery does not cease in those who harbor such thoughts. When we nourish hatred in our mind, our negative thoughts do more damage to us than the object of our hatred. It has been very sagaciously stated: \u201cResentment is like drinking poison and hoping that the other person dies.\u201d The problem is that most people do not even realize that their own uncontrolled mind is causing them so much harm. Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj advises: mana ko mano shatru usaki sunahu jani kachhu pyare (Sadhan Bhakti Tattva)[v1] \u201cDear spiritual aspirant, look on your uncontrolled mind as your enemy. Do not come under its sway.\u201d However, the same mind has the potential of becoming our best friend, if we bring it under control of the intellect, through spiritual practice. The more powerful an entity is, the greater is the danger of its misuse, and also the greater is the scope for its utilization. Since the mind is such a powerful machine fitted into our bodies, it can work as a two-edged sword. Thus, those who slide to demoniac levels do so because of their own mind while those who attain sublime heights also do so because of their purified minds. Accordingly, Franklin D. Roosevelt, former President of America, expressed this very nicely: \u201cMen are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.\u201d In this verse, Shree Krishna enlightens Arjun about the potential harm and benefits our mind can bestow upon us. In the following three verses, Shree Krishna describes the symptoms of one who is yog-aru?ha (advanced in Yog)."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna explained in verse 2.14 that the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives the mind the experience of heat and cold, joy and sorrow. As long as the mind has not been subdued, a person chases after the sensual perceptions of pleasure and recoils from the perceptions of pain. The yogi who conquers the mind is able to see these fleeting perceptions as the workings of the bodily senses, distinct from the immortal soul, and thus, remain unmoved by them. Such an advanced yogi rises above the dualities of heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.There are only two realms in which the mind may dwell\u2014one is the realm of Maya and the other is the realm of God. If the mind rises above the sensual dualities of the world, it can easily get absorbed in God. Thus, Shree Krishna has stated that an advanced yogi\u2019s mind becomes situated in sam\u0101dhi (deep meditation) upon God."

Vij\u00f1\u0101na is the realization of that knowledge as an internal awakening and wisdom from within. The intellect of the advanced yogi becomes illumined by both j\u00f1\u0101na and vij\u00f1\u0101na. Equipped with wisdom, the yogi sees all material objects as modifications of the material energy. Such a yogi does not differentiate between objects based on their attractiveness to the self. The enlightened yogi sees all things in their relationship with God. Since the material energy belongs to God, all things are meant for his service.\nThe word ku\u1e6dastha refers to one who distances the mind from the fluctuating perceptions of senses in contact with the material energy, neither seeking pleasurable situations nor avoiding unpleasurable ones. Vijitendriya is one who has subjugated the senses. The word yukt means one who is in constant communion with the Supreme. Such person begins tasting the divine bliss of God, and hence becomes a t\u1e5bipt\u0101tm\u0101, or one fully satisfied by virtue of realized knowledge."

        "commentary": "It is the nature of the human mind to respond differently to friends and foes. But an elevated yogi\u2019s nature is different. Endowed with realized knowledge of God, the elevated yogi see the whole creation in its unity with God. Thus, they are able to see all living beings with equality of vision. This parity of vision is also of various levels:\u201cAll living beings are divine souls, and hence parts of God.\u201d Thus, they are viewed as equal. \u0101tmavat sarva bh\u016bte\u1e63hu ya\u1e25 pa\u015bhyati sa pa\u1e47\u1e0dita\u1e25 \u201cA true Pundit is one who sees everyone as the soul, and hence similar to oneself.\u201dHigher is the vision: \u201cGod is seated in everyone, and hence all are equally respect worthy.\u201dAt the highest level, the yogi develops the vision: \u201cEveryone is the form of God.\u201d The Vedic scriptures repeatedly state that the whole world is a veritable form of God: \u012b\u015bh\u0101v\u0101syam idam sarva\u1e41 yat ki\u00f1cha jagaty\u0101\u1e41 jagat (\u012a\u015bhopani\u1e63had 1)[v2] \u201cThe entire universe, with all its living and non-living beings is the manifestation of the Supreme Being, who dwells within it.\u201d puru\u1e63ha eveda\u1e41 sarva\u1e41 (Puru\u1e63h S\u016bktam)[v3] \u201cGod is everywhere in this world, and everything is his energy.\u201d Hence, the highest yogi sees everyone as the manifestation of God. Endowed with this level of vision, Hanuman says: s\u012by\u0101 r\u0101ma maya saba jaga j\u0101n\u012b (Ramayan)[v4] \u201cI see the face of Sita Ram in everyone.\u201dThese categories have been further detailed in the commentary to verse 6.31. Referring to all three of the above categories, Shree Krishna says that the yogi who can maintain an equal vision toward all persons is even more elevated than the yogi mentioned in the previous verse. Having described the state of Yog, starting with the next verse, Shree Krishna describes the practice by which we can achieve that state."

        "commentary": "Having stated the characteristics of one who has attained the state of Yog, Shree Krishna now talks about the self-preparation required for it. Mastery in any field requires daily practice. An Olympic swimming champion is not one who goes to the local neighborhood swimming pool once a week on Saturday evenings. Only one who practices for several hours every day achieves the mastery required to win the Olympics. Practice is essential for spiritual mastery as well. Shree Krishna now explains the process of accomplishing spiritual mastery by recommending the daily practice of meditation. The first point he mentions is the need for a secluded place. All day long, we are usually surrounded by a worldly environment; these material activities, people, and conversations, all tend to make the mind more worldly. In order to elevate the mind toward God, we need to dedicate some time on a daily basis for secluded s\u0101dhan\u0101.The analogy of milk and water can help elucidate this point. If milk is poured into water, it cannot retain its undiluted identity, for water naturally mixes with it. However, if the milk is kept separate from water and converted into yogurt, and then the yogurt is churned to extract butter, the butter becomes immiscible. It can now challenge the water, \u201cI will sit on your head and float; you can do nothing to me because I have become butter now.\u201d Our mind is like the milk and the world is like water. In contact with the world, the mind gets affected by it and becomes worldly. However, an environment of seclusion, which offers minimal contact with the objects of the senses, becomes conducive for elevating the mind and focusing it upon God. Once sufficient attachment for God has been achieved, one can challenge the world, \u201cI will live amidst all the dualities of Maya, but remain untouched by them.\u201dThis instruction for seclusion has been repeated by Shree Krishna in verse 18.52: vivikt sev\u012b laghv\u0101\u015bh\u012b  \u201cLive in a secluded place; control your diet.\u201d There is a beautiful way of practically applying this instruction without disturbing our professional and social works. In our daily schedule, we can allocate some time for s\u0101dhan\u0101, or spiritual practice, where we isolate ourselves in a room that is free from worldly disturbances. Shutting ourselves out from the world, we should do s\u0101dhan\u0101 to purify the mind and solidify its focus upon God. If we practice in this manner for one to two hours every day, we will reap its benefits all through the day even while engaged in worldly activities. In this manner we will be able to retain the elevated state of consciousness that was gathered during the daily s\u0101dhan\u0101 in isolation from the world."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna explains in this verse the external practice for s\u0101dhan\u0101. \u015ahuchau de\u015bhe means a pure or sanctified place. In the initial stages, the external environment does impact the mind. In later stages of s\u0101dhan\u0101, one is able to achieve internal purity even in dirty and unclean places. But for neophytes, clean surroundings help in keeping the mind clean as well. A mat of Ku\u015bh grass provides temperature insulation from the ground, akin to the yoga mats of today. The deer skin atop it deters poisonous pests like snakes and scorpions from approaching while one is absorbed in meditation. If the \u0101san is too high, there is the risk of falling off; if the \u0101san is too low, there is danger of disturbance from insects on the ground. Some instructions regarding external seating given in this verse may be somewhat anachronous to modern times, in which case the spirit of the instruction is to be absorbed in the thought of God, while the instructions for the internal practice remain the same."

        "commentary": "Having described the seating for meditation, Shree Krishna next describes the posture of the body that is best for concentrating the mind. In s\u0101dhan\u0101, there is a tendency to become lazy and doze off to sleep. This happens because the material mind does not initially get as much bliss in contemplation on God as it does while relishing sense objects. This creates the possibility for the mind to become languid when focused on God. Hence, you do not find people dozing off half-way through their meal, but you do see people falling asleep during meditation and the chanting of God\u2019s names. To avoid this, Shree Krishna gives the instruction to sit erect. The Brahma S\u016btra also states three aphorisms regarding the posture for meditation:\u0101s\u012bna\u1e25 sambhav\u0101t  (4.1.7)[v5] \u201cTo do s\u0101dhan\u0101, seat yourself properly.\u201dachalatva\u1e41 ch\u0101pek\u1e63hya (4.1.9)[v6] \u201cEnsure that you sit erect and still.\u201ddhy\u0101n\u0101chcha (4.1.8)[v7] \u201cSeated in this manner, focus the mind in meditation.\u201dThere are a number of meditative \u0101sans described in the Hath Yoga Pradeepika, such as padmasan, ardha padmasan, dhyanveer asan, siddhasan, and sukhasan. We may adopt any \u0101san in which we can comfortably sit, without moving, during the period of the meditation. Maharshi Pata\u00f1jali states:sthira sukham\u0101sanam (Pata\u00f1jali Yog S\u016btra 2.46)[v8]\u201cTo practice meditation, sit motionless in any posture that you are comfortable in.\u201d Some people are unable to sit on the floor due to knee problems, etc. They should not feel discouraged, for they can even practice meditation while sitting on a chair, provided they fulfill the condition of sitting motionless and erect.In this verse, Shree Krishna states that the eyes should be made to focus on the tip of the nose, and prevented from wandering. As a variation, the eyes can also be kept closed. Both these techniques will be helpful in blocking out worldly distractions.The external seat and posture do need to be appropriate, but meditation is truly a journey within us. Through meditation, we can reach deep within and cleanse the mind of endless lifetimes of dross. By learning to hold the mind in concentration, we can work upon it to harness its latent potential. The practice of meditation helps organize our personality, awaken our inner consciousness, and expand our self-awareness. The spiritual benefits of meditation are described later, in the purport on verse 6.15. Some of the side benefits are:It reins the unbridled mind, and harnesses the thought energy to attain difficult goals.It helps maintain mental balance in the midst of adverse circumstances.It aids in the development of a strong resolve that is necessary for success in life.It enables one to eliminate bad sansk\u0101rs and habits, and cultivate good qualities.The best kind of meditation is one where the mind is focused upon God.

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna emphasizes the practice of celibacy for success in meditation. The sexual desire facilitates the process of procreation in the animal kingdom, and animals indulge in it primarily for that purpose. In most species, there is a particular mating season; animals do not indulge in sexual activity wantonly. Since humans have greater intellects and the freedom to indulge at will, the activity of procreation is converted into a means of licentious enjoyment. However, the Vedic scriptures lay great emphasis on practicing celibacy. Maharshi Patanjali states:brahmacharya prati\u1e63h\u1e6dh\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 v\u012brya l\u0101bha\u1e25 (Yog S\u016btras 2.38)[v9]\u201cThe practice of celibacy leads to great enhancement of energy.\u201dAyurveda, the Indian science of medicine extolls brahmacharya (the practice of celibacy) for its exceptional health benefits. One of the students of Dhanvantari approached his teacher after finishing his full course of Ayurveda (the ancient Indian science of medicine), and asked: \u201cO Sage, now kindly let me know the secret of health.\u201d Dhanvantari replied: \u201cThis seminal energy is verily the \u0101tman. The secret of health lies in preservation of this vital force. He who wastes this vital and precious energy cannot have physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development.\u201d According to Ayurveda, forty drops of blood go into making one drop of semen. Those who waste their semen develop unsteady and agitated pr\u0101\u1e47. They lose their physical and mental energy, and weaken their memory, mind, and intellect. The practice of celibacy leads to a boost of bodily energy, clarity of intellect, gigantic will power, retentive memory, and a keen spiritual intellect. It creates a sparkle in the eyes and a luster on the cheeks.The definition of celibacy is not restricted to mere abstinence from physical indulgence. The Agni Pur\u0101\u1e47 states that the eightfold activities related to sex must be controlled: 1) Thinking about it. 2) Talking about it. 3) Joking about it. 4) Envisioning it. 5) Desiring it. 6) Wooing to get someone interested in it. 7) Enticing someone interested in it. 8) Engaging in it. For one to be considered celibate, all these must be shunned. Thus, celibacy not only requires abstinence from sexual intercourse, but also refrainment from masturbation, homosexual acts, and all other sexual practices.Further, Shree Krishna states here that the object of meditation should be God alone. This point is again reiterated in the next verse."

        "commentary": "Varieties of techniques for meditation exist in the world. There are Zen techniques, Buddhist techniques, Tantric techniques, Taoist techniques, Vedic techniques, and so on. Each of these has many sub-branches. Amongst the followers of Hinduism itself, there are innumerable techniques being practiced. Which of these should we adopt for our personal practice? Shree Krishna makes this riddle easy to solve. He states that the object of meditation should be God himself and God alone.The aim of meditation is not merely to enhance concentration and focus, but also to purify the mind. Meditating on the breath, chakras, void, flame, etc. is helpful in developing focus. However, the purification of the mind is only possible when we fix it upon an all-pure object, which is God himself. Hence, verse 14.26 states that God is beyond the three modes of material nature, and when one fixes the mind upon him, it too rises above the three modes. Thus, meditating upon the pr\u0101\u1e47as may be called transcendental by its practitioners, but true transcendental meditation is upon God alone.Now what is the way of fixing the mind upon God? We can make all of God\u2019s divine attributes\u2014names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, associates\u2014the objects of meditation. They are all non-different from God and replete with all his energies. Hence, devotees may meditate upon any of these and get the true benefit of meditating upon God. In the various bhakti traditions in India, the name of God is made the basis of contemplation. Thus, the Ramayan states:brahma r\u0101m te\u1e45 n\u0101mu ba\u1e5ba, bara d\u0101yaka bara d\u0101ni [v10]\u201cGod\u2019s name is bigger than God himself, in terms of its utility to the souls.\u201d Taking the name is a very convenient way of remembering God, since it can be taken anywhere and everywhere\u2014while walking, talking, sitting, eating, etc.However, for most s\u0101dhaks the name by itself is not sufficiently attractive for enchanting the mind. Due to sansk\u0101rs of endless lifetimes, the mind is naturally drawn to forms. Using the form of God as the basis, meditation becomes natural and easy. This is called r\u016bp dhy\u0101n meditation.Once the mind is focused upon the form of God, we can then further enhance it by contemplating upon the virtues of God\u2014his compassion, his beauty, his knowledge, his love, his benevolence, his grace, and so on. One can then advance in meditation by serving God in the mind. We can visualize ourselves offering foodstuffs to him, worshipping him, singing to him, massaging him, fanning him, bathing him, cooking for him, etc. This is called m\u0101nas\u012b sev\u0101 (serving God in the mind). In this way, we can meditate upon the names, forms, virtues, pastimes, etc. of God. All these become powerful means of fulfilling Shree Krishna\u2019s instruction to Arjun, in this verse, to keep the mind absorbed in him.At the end of the verse, Shree Krishna gives the ultimate benefits of meditation, which are liberation from Maya and the everlasting beatitude of God-realization."

        "commentary": "After describing the object of meditation and the end-goal achieved by it, Shree Krishna gives some regulations to follow. He states that those who break the rules of bodily maintenance cannot be successful in Yog. Often beginners on the path, with their incomplete wisdom state: \u201cYou are the soul and not this body. So simply engage in spiritual activity, forgetting about the maintenance of the body.\u201dHowever, such a philosophy cannot get one too far. It is true that we are not the body, yet the body is our carrier as long as we live, and we are obliged to take care of it. The Ayurvedic text, Charak Samhit\u0101 states: \u015bhar\u012bra m\u0101dhya\u1e41 khalu dharma s\u0101dhanam [v11] \u201cThe body is the vehicle for engaging in religious activity.\u201d If the body becomes unwell, then spiritual pursuits get impeded too. The Ramayan states: tanu binu bhajana veda nahi\u1e45 varan\u0101 [v12] \u201cThe Vedas do not recommend that we ignore the body, while engaging in spirituality.\u201d In fact, they instruct us to take good care of our body with the help of material science. The \u012a\u015bhopani\u1e63had states:andha\u1e41 tama\u1e25 pravi\u015bhanti ye \u2019vidy\u0101m up\u0101satetato bh\u016bya iva te tamo ya u vidy\u0101y\u0101m rat\u0101\u1e25 (9)[v13]\u201cThose who cultivate only material science go to hell. But those who cultivate only spiritual science go to an even darker hell.\u201d Material science is necessary for the maintenance of our body, while spiritual science is necessary for the manifestation of the internal divinity within us. We must balance both in our lives to reach the goal of life. Hence, yog\u0101sans, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101m, and the science of proper diet are an essential part of Vedic knowledge. Each of the four Vedas has its associate Veda for material knowledge. The associate Veda of Atharva Veda is Ayurveda, which is the hoary science of medicine and good health. This demonstrates that the Vedas lay emphasis on the maintenance of physical health. Accordingly, Shree Krishna says that overeating or not eating at all, extreme activity or complete inactivity, etc. are all impediments to Yog. Spiritual practitioners should take good care of their body, by eating fresh nutritious food, doing daily exercise, and getting the right amount of sleep every night."

        "commentary": "Yog is the union of the soul with God. The opposite of Yog is bhog, which means engagement in sensual pleasures. Indulgence in bhog violates the natural laws of the body, and results in rog (disease). As stated in the previous verse, if the body becomes diseased, it impedes the practice of Yog. Thus in this verse, Shree Krishna states that by being temperate in bodily activities and practicing Yog, we can become free from the sorrows of the body and mind.\nThe same instruction was repeated two-and-a-half millennium after Shree Krishna by Gautam Buddha, when he recommended the golden middle path between severe asceticism and sensual indulgence. There is a beautiful story regarding this. It is said that before gaining enlightenment, Gautam Buddha once gave up eating and drinking, and sat in meditation. However, after a few days of practicing in this manner, the lack of nourishment made him weak and dizzy, and he found it impossible to steady his mind in meditation. At that time, some village women happened to be passing by. They were carrying water pots on their heads that they had filled from the river nearby, and were singing a song. The words of the song were: \u201cTighten the strings of the t\u0101npur\u0101 (a stringed Indian musical instrument, resembling a guitar). But do not tighten them so much that the strings break.\u201d Their words entered the ears of Gautam Buddha, and he exclaimed, \u201cThese illiterate village women are singing such words of wisdom. They contain a message for us humans. We too should tighten our bodies (practice austerities), but not to the extent that the body is destroyed.\u201d\nBenjamin Franklin (1706 \u2013 1790), a founding father of the United States, is highly regarded as a self-made man. In an effort to grow his character, starting at the age of 20, he maintained a diary in which he tracked his performance related to the 13 activities he wanted to grow in. The first activity was \u201cTemperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\u201d"

At the end of this very chapter, he also states: \u201cOf all yogis, those whose minds are always absorbed in me, and who engage in devotion to me with great faith, them I consider\u00a0to be the highest of all.\u201d (Verse 6.47)"

However, in a windless place, the flame becomes as steady as a picture. Similarly, the mind is fickle by nature and very difficult to control. But when the mind of a yogi is in enthralled union with God, it becomes sheltered against the winds of desire. Such a yogi holds the mind steadily under control by the power of devotion."

When the mind is purified, one is able to perceive the self as distinct from the body, mind, and intellect. For example, if there is muddy water in a glass, we cannot see through it. However, if we put alum in the water, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear. Similarly, when the mind is unclean, it obscures perception of the soul and any acquired scriptural knowledge of the \u0101tm\u0101 is only at the theoretical level.

A number of quotations from the Vedic scriptures establishing this were mentioned in verse 5.21. Here are some more quotations expressing the nature of God as having an infinite ocean of bliss:raso vai sa\u1e25 rasa\u1e41 hyev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 nand\u012b bhavati  (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had 2.7)[v14]\u201cGod is bliss himself; the individual soul becomes blissful on attaining him.\u201d\u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t (Brahma S\u016btra 1.1.12)[v15]\u201cGod is the veritable form of bliss.\u201dsatya j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101nant\u0101nanda m\u0101traika rasa m\u016brtaya\u1e25  (Bh\u0101gavatam 10.13.54)[v16]\u201cThe divine form of God is made of eternity, knowledge, and bliss.\u201d\u0101nanda sindhu madhya tava v\u0101s\u0101, binu j\u0101ne kata marasi piy\u0101s\u0101 (Ramayan)[v17]\u201cGod, who is the ocean of bliss, is seated within you. Without knowing him, how can your thirst for happiness be satiated?\u201dWe have been seeking perfect bliss for eons, and everything we do is in search of that bliss. However, from the objects of gratification, the mind and senses perceive only a shadowy reflection of true bliss. This sensual gratification fails to satisfy the longing of the soul within, which yearns for the infinite bliss of God.When the mind is in union with God, the soul experiences the ineffable and sublime bliss beyond the scope of the senses. This state is called sam\u0101dhi in the Vedic scriptures. The Sage Patanjali states: sam\u0101dhisiddhir\u012b\u015bhvara pra\u1e47idh\u0101n\u0101t  (Pata\u00f1jali Yog Dar\u015bhan 2.45)[v18] \u201cFor success in sam\u0101dhi, surrender to the Supreme Lord.\u201d In the state of sam\u0101dhi, experiencing complete satisfaction and contentment, the soul has nothing left to desire, and thus becomes firmly situated in the Absolute Truth, without deviating from it for even a moment."

        "commentary": "In the material realm, no extent of attainment satiates a person totally. A poor person strives hard to become rich, and feels satisfied if he or she is able to become a millionaire. But when that same millionaire looks at a billionaire, discontentment sets in again. The billionaire is also discontented by looking at an even richer person. No matter what happiness we get, when we perceive a higher state of happiness, the feeling of unfulfillment lingers. But happiness achieved from the state of Yog is the infinite bliss of God. Since there is nothing higher than that, on experiencing that infinite bliss, the soul naturally perceives that it has reached its goal.\nGod\u2019s divine bliss is also eternal, and it can never be snatched away from the yogi who has attained it once. Such a God-realized soul, though residing in the material body, remains in the state of divine consciousness. Sometimes, externally, it seems that the Saint is facing tribulations in the form of illness, antagonistic people, and oppressive environment, but internally the Saint retains divine consciousness and continues to relish the bliss of God. Thus, even the biggest difficulty cannot shake such a Saint. Established in union with God, the Saint rises above bodily consciousness and is thus not affected by bodily harm. Accordingly, we hear from the Puranas how Prahlad was put in a pit of snakes, tortured with weapons, placed in the fire, thrown off a cliff, etc. but none of these difficulties could break Prahlad\u2019s devotional union with God."

Thus, the material energy Maya is compared to darkness. It has put us in the darkness of ignorance and is making us suffer in the world. However, the darkness of Maya naturally gets dispelled when we bring the light of God into our heart. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states this very beautifully:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a s\u016brya-sama, m\u0101y\u0101 haya andhak\u0101ra y\u0101h\u0101\u00f1 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a, t\u0101h\u0101\u00f1 n\u0101hi m\u0101y\u0101ra adhik\u0101ra(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, Madhya Leela, 22.31)[v19]\u201cGod is like the light and Maya is like darkness. Just as darkness does not have the power to engulf light, similarly Maya can never overcome God.\u201d Now, the nature of God is divine bliss while the consequence of Maya is misery. Thus, one who attains the divine bliss of God can never be overcome by the misery of Maya again.Thus, the state of Yog implies both 1) attainment of bliss, and 2) freedom from misery. Shree Krishna emphasizes both successively. In the previous verse, the attainment of bliss was highlighted as the result of Yog; in this verse, freedom from misery is being emphasized.In the second line of this verse Shree Krishna states that the stage of perfection has to be reached through determined practice. He then goes on to explain how we must practice meditation."

When we sit for meditation with the resolve to focus our mind upon God, we will find that ever so often it wanders off in worldly sa\u1e45kalp and vikalp. It is thus important to understand the three steps involved in the process of meditation:\nWith the intellect\u2019s power of discrimination we decide that the world is not our goal. Hence, we forcefully remove the mind from the world. This requires effort.\nAgain, with the power of discrimination we understand that God alone is ours, and God-realization is our goal. Hence, we bring the mind to focus upon God. This also requires effort.\nThe mind comes away from God, and wanders back into the world. This does not require effort, it happens automatically.\nWhen the third step happens by itself, s\u0101dhaks often become disappointed, \u201cI tried so hard to focus upon God, but the mind went back into the world.\u201d Shree Krishna asks us not to feel disappointed. He says the mind is fickle and we should be prepared that it will wander off in the direction of its infatuation, despite our best efforts to control it. However, when it does wander off, we should once again repeat steps 1 and 2\u2014take the mind away from the world and bring it back to God. Once again, we will experience that step 3 takes place by itself. We should not lose heart, and again repeat steps 1 and 2.\nWe will have to do this repeatedly. Then slowly, the mind\u2019s attachment toward God will start increasing. And simultaneously, its detachment from the world will also increase. As this happens, it will become easier and easier to meditate. But in the beginning, we must be prepared for the battle involved in disciplining the mind."

The answer is embedded in this verse. When we find our inner transcendental bliss increasing, we can consider it as a symptom that our mind is coming under control and the consciousness is getting spiritually elevated. Here, Shree Krishna says that when we are \u015bh\u0101nta-rajasa\u1e41 (free from passion) and akalma\u1e63ham (sinless), then we will become brahma-bh\u016btam (endowed with God-realization).

The easy way to unite the mind with God is to learn to see everything in its connection with him. For example, let us say that someone hurts us. It is the nature of the mind to develop sentiments of resentment, hatred, etc. toward anyone who harms us. However, if we permit that to happen, then our mind comes away from the divine realm, and the devotional union of our mind with God ceases. Instead, if we see the Supreme Lord seated in that person, we will think, \u201cGod is testing me through this person. He wants me to increase the virtue of tolerance, and that is why he is inspiring this person to behave badly with me. But I will not permit the incident to disturb me.\u201d Thinking in this way, we will be able to prevent the mind from becoming a victim of negative sentiments.Similarly, the mind separates from God when it gets attached to a friend or relative. Now, if we train the mind to see God in that person, then each time the mind wanders toward him or her, we will think, \u201cShree Krishna is seated in this person, and thus I am feeling this attraction.\u201d In this manner, the mind will continue to retain its devotional absorption in the Supreme.Sometimes, the mind laments over past incidents. This again separates the mind from the divine realm because lamentation takes the mind into the past and the present contemplation of God and Guru ceases. Now if we see that incident in connection with God, we will think, \u201cThe Lord deliberately arranged for me to experience tribulation in the world, so that I may develop detachment. He is so concerned about my welfare that he mercifully arranges for the proper circumstances that are beneficial for my spiritual progress.\u201d By thinking thus, we will be able to protect our devotional focus. Sage Narad states:loka h\u0101nau chint\u0101 na k\u0101ry\u0101 nivedit\u0101tma loka vedatv\u0101t (N\u0101rad Bhakti Darshan, S\u016btra 61)[v23]\u201cWhen you suffer a reversal in the world, do not lament or brood over it. See the grace of God in that incident.\u201d Our self-interest lies in somehow or the other keeping the mind in God, and the simple trick to accomplish this is to see God in everything and everyone.

Shree Krishna has just finished explaining that for perfection in Yog we must:\n\u2014 subdue the senses\n\u2014 give up all desires\n\u2014 focus the mind upon God alone\n\u2014 think of him with an unwavering mind\n\u2014 see everyone with equal vision\nArjun frankly expresses his reservation about what he has heard by saying that it is impracticable. None of the above can be accomplished without controlling the mind. If the mind is restless, then all these aspects of Yog become unattainable as well."

        "commentary": "Arjun speaks for us all when he describes the troublesome mind. It is restless because it keeps flitting in different directions, from subject to subject. It is turbulent because it creates upheavals in one\u2019s consciousness, in the form of hatred, anger, lust, greed, envy, anxiety, fear, attachment, etc. It is strong because it overpowers the intellect with its vigorous currents and destroys the faculty of discrimination. The mind is also obstinate because when it catches a harmful thought, it refuses to let go, and continues to ruminate over it again and again, even to the dismay of the intellect. Thus enumerating its unwholesome characteristics, Arjun declares that the mind is even more difficult to control than the wind. It is a powerful analogy for no one can ever think of controlling the mighty wind in the sky.\nIn this verse, Arjun has addressed the Lord as Krishna. The word \u201cKrishna\u201d means: kar\u1e63hati yogin\u0101\u1e41 paramahans\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 chet\u0101nsi iti k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a\u1e25 [v25] \u201cKrishna is he who forcefully attracts the minds of even the most powerfully-minded yogis and paramahansas.\u201d Arjun is thus indicating that Krishna should also attract his restless, turbulent, strong, and obstinate mind."

Can you not defeat the mind?\u201d\nShree Krishna does not deny the problem, by saying, \u201cArjun, what nonsense are you speaking? The mind can be controlled very easily.\u201d Rather, he agrees with Arjun\u2019s statement that the mind is indeed difficult to control. However, so many things are difficult to achieve in the world and yet we remain undaunted and move forward. For example, sailors know that the sea is dangerous and the possibility of terrible storms exists. Yet, they have never found those dangers as sufficient reasons for remaining ashore. Hence, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that the mind can be controlled by vair\u0101gya and abhy\u0101s.\nVair\u0101gya means detachment. We observe that the mind runs toward the objects of its attachment, toward the direction it has been habituated to running in the past. The elimination of attachment eradicates the unnecessary wanderings of the mind.\nAbhy\u0101s means practice, or a concerted and persistent effort to change an old habit or develop a new one. Practice is a very important word for s\u0101dhaks. In all fields of human endeavor, practice is the key that opens the door to mastery and excellence. Take, for example, a mundane activity such as typing. The first time people begin typing, they are able to type one word in a minute. But after a year\u2019s typing, their fingers fly on the keyboard at the speed of eighty words a minute. This proficiency comes solely through practice. Similarly, the obstinate and turbulent mind has to be made to rest on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord through abhy\u0101s. Take the mind away from the world\u2014this is vair\u0101gya\u2014and bring the mind to rest on God\u2014this is abhy\u0101s. Sage Patanjali gives the same instruction:\nabhy\u0101sa vair\u0101gy\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41 tannirodha\u1e25  (Yog Dar\u015bhan 1.12)[v26]\n\u201cThe perturbations of the mind can be controlled by constant practice and detachment.\u201d"

He says that those who have not learnt to bridle the mind through abhy\u0101s and vair\u0101gya find great difficulty in the practice of Yog. But those who have brought the mind under their control through persistent effort can achieve success by adopting the proper means. The perfect process has already been described by him from verses 6.10 to 6.32. It includes subduing the senses, giving up all desires, focusing the mind upon God alone, thinking of him with an unwavering mind, and seeing everyone with equal vision.This statement creates a doubt in Arjun\u2019s mind regarding the s\u0101dhak who is unable to control the mind, and he now questions Shree Krishna in this regard."

And those who consider spiritual wealth to be the real treasure worthy of possessing, strive for it by rejecting material endeavors. However, if such spiritualists fail in their attempt, they are apparently left with neither spiritual nor material assets. Thinking in this manner, Arjun asks whether their position is like that of a broken cloud. A cloud, which breaks away from the group of clouds, becomes worthless. It neither offers sufficient shade, nor does it increase its weight and become rain-bearing. It merely blows in the wind and perishes like a non-entity in the sky. Arjun asks whether the unsuccessful yogi suffers a similar fate, with no position in any sphere."

Shree Krishna declares the bhakti yogi to be the highest, superior to even the best a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yogi and ha\u1e6dha yogi. That is because bhakti , or devotion, is the highest power of God. It is such a power that binds God and makes him a slave of his devotee.

It comes from the root word bhaj, which means \u201cto serve.\u201d It is a far more significant word for devotion than \u201cworship,\u201d which means \u201cto adore.\u201d Here, Shree Krishna is talking about those who, not merely adore him, but also serve him with loving devotion. They are thus established in the natural position of the soul as the servant of God, while the other kinds of yogis are still incomplete in their realization.

An example to explain this is honey kept in a sealed jar. We have heard that honey has the sweetest taste that is incomparable to any other sweet. But unless we open the jar and taste it, we will not get the experiential realization of its sweetness.Likewise, the Guru gives us j\u00f1\u0101na, which is the theoretical knowledge of the scriptures.

And even among those perfected souls, ones who are aware of My divine glories and paramount position are very rare.\u201d\u00a0How is it that even perfected souls are unable to know God? The reason is without bhakti or loving devotion, it is not possible to realize the Supreme. Spiritual aspirants of karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, ha\u1e6dha yog, etc., cannot know God unless they include devotion in their practice. \u00a0Shree Krishna has stated this fact several times in the Bhagavad Gita:\u201cThe Supreme Divine Personality is greater than all that exists.

To make it comprehensible to our finite intellect, we have classified it into various categories and sub-categories.\u00a0 Modern science propagates matter to be a combination of elements, and the 118 elements discovered so far, are sectioned under the Periodic Table.However, the Vedic philosophy and the Bhagavad Gita present a profoundly different classification of the material world. Matter is considered as part of God\u2019s energy and called prak\u1e5biti. It is further divided into eight forms, as listed in this verse. It is amazing how insightful the knowledge in these ancient scriptures is in comparison to the developing trends in modern science.Albert Einstein was the first to propound the concept of Mass-Energy Equivalence in 1905. In his Annus Mirabilis papers, he stated that it is possible to convert mass into energy and numerically presented it by an equation E=mc2. His Theory of Relativity replaced an earlier concept of the universe made of solid matter. Both these theories were challenged in 1920 by Niels Bohr and other scientists with Quantum Theory, which proposes a dual particle-wave nature of matter. Ever since, the scientific community has been on the lookout for a single field or Unified Field Theory, which could expound on the relationship between matter and all forces of the universe.More than 5000 years ago, long before the development of modern science, Lord Krishna had disclosed the perfect Unified Field Theory. He said to Arjun, \u201cAll that exists in the universe has manifested from My material energy.\u201d Just one material energy has extended itself into myriad shapes, forms, and entities of this world. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had has elaborated on this:tasmadv\u0101 etasm\u0101d\u0101tmana \u0101k\u0101\u015bha\u1e25 sambh\u016bta\u1e25\u0101k\u0101\u015bh\u0101dv\u0101yu\u1e25 v\u0101yoragni\u1e25 agner\u0101pa\u1e25 adbhya\u1e25 p\u1e5bithiv\u012bp\u1e5bithivy\u0101 o\u1e63hadhaya\u1e25 o\u1e63hadh\u012bbhyo \u2019nnam ann\u0101tpuru\u1e63ha\u1e25sa v\u0101 e\u1e63ha puru\u1e63ho \u2019nnarasamaya\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0 (2.1.2)\"From My material energy the \u0101k\u0101\u015bha\u1e25 (ether) was created,\u00a0from ether\u00a0the air; from\u00a0air, fire; from fire, water; from water, earth; from earth, plants; from plants, food and\u00a0from food, man. This man is made\u00a0of food-essence.\"The material energy in its primordial form is called prak\u1e5biti. God glances at it when He wishes to create the world. His glance agitates and creates mah\u0101n. (There is no equivalent word for it in English, as modern science is yet to discover such a subtle level of energy) Mah\u0101n further manifests into ahank\u0101r even this is unknown to modern science. Ahank\u0101r, in turn, forms the pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s or the five perceptions of \u2013 taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound. And from these, the five gross elements\u2014 space, air, fire, water, and earth manifest.Lord Shree Krishna includes the mind, intellect, and ego along with the five gross elements as different manifestations of His material energy. In this verse, He states that all these eight elements are simply parts of Maya, His material energy. In the next verse, He describes another of His superior energy; the soul energy."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that beyond the eight-fold prak\u1e5biti, the material energy, which He says is inferior; there exists another that is far more superior. This energy is completely transcendental as compared to the lifeless matter. It is His spiritual energy, the j\u012bva \u015bhakti, which includes all the living souls of the world. Now, He has moved from explaining material science toward the spiritual realm.Many great philosophers of India have given their perspectives and described the relationship between God and the j\u012bva, the individual soul.\u00a0 For example, the non-dualists state: j\u012bvo brahmaiva n\u0101para\u1e25 \u201cThe soul itself is God.\u201d\u00a0 But this concept gives rise to several questions, such as:How can the\u00a0soul itself be God? God is most powerful, and Maya is His subservient energy. The souls are always overpowered by; Maya. Then is Maya stronger than God?The individual soul is always; gripped by ignorance and misery. It needs a continuous reminder from the saints and scriptures, even about its existence and purpose. How can God, who is all-knowing, be considered a soul which is subject to ignorance?The Vedas repeatedly state that God is all-pervading in this world and beyond. Similarly, individual souls should also be able to exist anywhere at any given time. Then what about the question of going to heaven or hell after death?There is only one God, but the souls are countless. If the soul itself is God, then there should be many Gods. Therefore, the claims by non-dualistic philosophers that the soul itself is God are inconclusive.The dualist philosophers\u2019 state that the souls and God are separate. Even though it may answer some of the above questions, yet it is still an incomplete philosophy in light of what Shree Krishna states in this verse. He says that the soul is a part of j\u012bva \u015bhakti God\u2019s spiritual energy. And as explained earlier, Maya, the material energy, is also His subservient. Thus, God is supreme; He is the governor of both the lower material and the higher spiritual energies.\u00a0Now let us see what the scriptures and various saints have said:eka-de\u015bha-sthitasy\u0101gnir jyotsn\u0101 vist\u0101rin\u0323\u012b yath\u0101parasya brahman\u0323ah\u0323 \u015bhaktis tathedam akhila\u1e41 jagat\u00a0 (Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47 1.22.53)\u201cJust as the sun resides in one place but its sunlight pervades; the entire solar system. Similarly, there is one God, who by His infinite powers pervades the three worlds.\u201d\u00a0Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0j\u012bva-tattva \u015bhakti, k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a-tattva \u015bhaktim\u0101ng\u012bt\u0101-vi\u1e63h\u1e47upur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di t\u0101h\u0101te pram\u0101\u1e47a\u00a0\u00a0 (Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela, 7.117)\u201cThe soul is the energy of God, while He is the Supreme Energetic.\u201dOnce we understand and accept that the soul is a small part of God\u2019s infinite energy, the concept of non-duality of the entire creation becomes clear. Energies can exist concurrently within the same energetic. For example, fire contains both heat and light, which are different entities and have different properties. But they are part of the same fire which emits them. Likewise, God as the Energetic and the souls His energy can be considered one. At the same time, due to their distinct properties, both entities are different from each other.\u00a0Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has encapsulated and perfectly expressed Shree Krishna\u2019s statement in this and the previous verse:j\u012bvu\u2019 \u2018m\u0101y\u0101\u2019, dui \u015bhakti hai\u00f1, \u015bhaktim\u0101n bhagav\u0101n\u015bhaktihi\u00f1 bheda abheda bh\u012b, \u015bhaktim\u0101n te j\u0101n \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 42)\u201cThe soul and Maya are both energies of God.\u00a0 Hence, they are both one with God and also different from God.\u201dConsidering the unison of both; the Energetic and His energies, it is stated that God and His creation are non-different. The entire world is a veritable form of God.sarva\u1e41 khalvida\u1e41 brahma\u00a0\u00a0 (Chh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63had 3.14.1)\u201cAll is Brahman.\u201d\u012b\u015bh\u0101v\u0101syam idam sarva\u1e41\u00a0\u00a0 (\u012a\u015bhopani\u1e63had 1)\u201cEverything that exists in the world is God.\u201dpuru\u1e63ha eveda\u1e41 sarva\u1e41\u00a0\u00a0 (\u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had 3.15)\u201cThe Supreme Divine Personality is everything that exists.\u201dAccording to these Vedic verses, there is only one God and nothing else. Yet, when we consider the Energetic and energy concept, there is diversity within this unity and an incredible variety. God, the souls, and matter, all three are different entities with different properties. God is Supremely sentient; He is the source of both the souls and the matter. Yet, souls are sentient, and the matter insentient.The scriptures also state the existence of three entities in creation:k\u1e63hara\u1e41 pradh\u0101namam\u1e5bit\u0101k\u1e63hara\u1e41 hara\u1e25k\u1e63har\u0101tm\u0101n\u0101v\u012b\u015bhate deva eka\u1e25tasy\u0101bhidhy\u0101n\u0101d yojan\u0101t tattvabh\u0101vadbh\u016bya\u015bhch\u0101nte vi\u015bhwam\u0101y\u0101niv\u1e5bitti\u1e25\u00a0(\u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had 1.10)\u201cThere are three entities in existence: 1) Matter, which is perishable.\u00a0 2) The individual souls who are imperishable.\u00a0 3) God, who is the controller of both matter and the souls.\u00a0 By meditating upon God, uniting with Him, and becoming more like Him, the soul is free from the world\u2019s illusion.\u201dThe Vedas have expounded on both dualistic and non-dualistic concepts. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has upheld the concepts of concurrent coherence, yet variance between the soul and God. This means God and the soul are one; yet, separate from each other."

        "commentary": "Living beings are a manifestation of God\u2019s two energies, j\u012bva \u015bhakti, the sentient soul energy, and Maya, the insentient material energy or matter. In the material realm, all life is a combination of both matter and soul. Matter by itself is insentient or lifeless, and the sentient soul needs a carrier body. Hence, both come together to form a living being.Similarly, the entire creation is a manifestation of God\u2019s energies. One cycle of creation lasts for 100 years of Brahma. Then the Supreme Lord starts the process of dissolution. The five gross elements merge into five subtle elements, which in turn merge into ahank\u0101r. Ahank\u0101r goes back into mah\u0101n, which again unites with prak\u1e5biti.\u00a0 Prak\u1e5biti now resides inside the body of Maha Vishnu (another form of the Supreme Lord).\u00a0 All the materially bound souls, which could not get liberated during this cycle of creation, also reside in God\u2019s body. They remain unmanifested, waiting for the next cycle of creation.When God decides to create, the entire cycle begins all over again\u00a0(as explained in\u00a0verse 7.4),\u00a0and a new world comes into existence. Therefore, God is the source, the sustainer, and the resting place for the entire creation."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna said in the previous verse that He is the origin, sustainer, and the basis of all that exists in this world. Now, He continues to explain it further in these four verses.The sweet taste of any fruit that we eat confirms the presence of Fructose or fruit sugar in it. Similarly, Shree Krishna reveals that He is present in all the modifications of His energies. He says He is the taste in water. What does that mean? Water hardly has any taste of its own. Yet, other forms of matter such as solids, fires, and gases need liquids to carry their taste.Have you ever tried putting a solid food item, on your dry tongue? Do you get any taste? Only when the saliva in our mouth dissolves some part of the solid, we start getting the taste as perceived by the taste buds on our tongue. After all, who can separate the taste of water from water? That is why Shree Krishna says that he is the taste in water. It is the intrinsic property of water to carry the taste of all substances; without water, there will be no taste.In the same way, \u0101k\u0101\u015bha (space) acts as the vehicle for sound. Different languages form due to sound modifications. Shree Krishna says He is the origin of it all, as the sound in space is His energy. He is the syllable Om the most important sound in the Vedic mantras. The sun and the moon get their radiance from Him. Even for all the abilities that manifest in humans, He is the ultimate energy source."

Similarly, Shree Krishna says in this verse that He is the cause (the eternal seed) from which all beings manifest.Have you ever thought about why some people are more intelligent than others? Why do they have greater brilliance in their thoughts and ideas? The only explanation for this can be; since all that exists is a manifestation of God\u2019s energy. The splendid qualities visible in such outstanding people can only be due to God\u2019s grace. As Shree Krishna has mentioned in this verse, He is the subtle force behind the intelligent and the glorious. He makes their minds more analytic and thoughts scintillating.Legend of modern history, such as William Shakespeare, displayed unmatched brilliance in the field of literature. That could have only been possible by God\u2019s grace. His works have nourished English literature, and English has now become the most used language of the world. Swami Vivekananda once said: the British Empire has united the world in one language.\u00a0Another such genius is Bill Gates, who changed the course of information technology with his Windows Operating System. With more than ninety percent of market share, Windows has become the most popular Operating System in the world. As it is very user-friendly, it has made information technology available to the public at large. The usage of computers is not limited to IT engineers anymore. Such inspiration to have one major operating system to unify the information technology industry and ensure proper interaction could only be through God\u2019s plan. God enhances one such person\u2019s intellect when he wants to save us from chaos.Of course, the saints have always acknowledged that the brilliance and beauty of their works are due to God\u2019s special grace. Sage Tulsidas said:\u00a0\u00a0na mai\u00f1 kiy\u0101 na kari sakau\u00f1, sahiba kart\u0101 morkarata kar\u0101vata \u0101ap\u00a0hai\u00f1, tulas\u012b tulas\u012b \u015bhor\u201cNeither did I write the Ramayan, nor do I have the ability to write it.\u00a0 The Lord is my Doer.\u00a0 He directs my actions and acts through me, but the world thinks that Tulsidas is doing them.\u201d\u00a0 Therefore, Lord Shree Krishna is indeed the ultimate source of all the brilliance and intelligence that manifests around us."

Whereas, it is regarded, in line with the scriptural injunctions and not a contrary virtue, when carried out for procreation by a householder.

These veil the human consciousness and cause fascination with the bodily pleasures which are short-lived.\u00a0The word \u201cMaya\u201d is made from m\u0101 (not) and y\u0101 (what is).\u00a0 Thus, Maya means \u201cthat which is not what it appears to be.\u201dMaya, being one of God\u2019s energy, is engaged in the service of hiding His true nature from the souls who are not yet eligible or God-realized. It lures and confuses the souls who are already vimukh (having their backs turned) from God. It also troubles them with problems and difficulties aided by the three-fold material miseries.

The soul itself is the Ultimate Reality, and once we understand that, all illusions shall dispel. However, this theory is negated by the Bhagavad Gita in this verse. Shree Krishna has already stated that Maya is an extension of His energy and not an illusion. The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had also states:\u00a0m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tu prak\u1e5biti\u1e41 vidy\u0101nm\u0101yina\u1e41 tu mahe\u015bhvaram\u00a0\u00a0 (4.10)\u201cMaya is the energy (prak\u1e5biti), while God is the Energetic.\u201d\u00a0The Ramayan states:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0so d\u0101s\u012b raghub\u012bra ki samujhe\u1e45 mithy\u0101 sopi\u201cSome people think Maya is mithy\u0101 (non-existent), but factually it is an energy engaged in the service of God.\u201d\u00a0Shree Krishna has mentioned here that because Maya is His energy, it is difficult to overcome. If someone claims they have defeated Maya, that would mean they have defeated God. No one can conquer God; therefore, Maya is equally invincible. The human mind is made of Maya merely by self-effort no yogi, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, ascetic, or karm\u012b can successfully control the mind.\u00a0One could then ask, \u201cIs it impossible to overcome Maya?\u201d The second line of this verse has the answer to this question. Shree Krishna says, \u201cThose who surrender themselves to Me, the Supreme Lord, then by My grace, they would smoothly cross the ocean of material existence. I will instruct Maya to leave this soul, now that it has become Mine.\u201d On God\u2019s instructions Maya, the material energy of God, simply releases the surrendered soul from its clutches. It says, \u201cMy job is to keep troubling the soul until it surrenders at the feet of God; once the soul reaches there, my job is complete.\u201dHere is an example from everyday life. Assume that you visit a friend who has a large house, outside on the gate, a board says, \u201cBeware of dog.\u201d When you look inside, a trained guard dog is standing on the lawn. As soon as it spots you, it starts growling menacingly, scared; you decide to take the back gate. But even before you reach the back of the house, it is waiting there for you and snarls furiously, as if saying, \u201cYou dare step into this house.\u201d You have no choice, and you shout your friend\u2019s name aloud. Hearing all the commotion, your friend comes and finds you at the gate troubled by his dog. He sternly says to the dog, \u201cNo, Tommy, that is a friend, we need to let him in, come and sit down here.\u201d Hearing his master\u2019s command, the dog silently goes and sits near him. You can now open the gate and let yourself in without fear.In the same way, we are in the clutches of Maya, the material energy. Although it is subservient to God, it keeps troubling us so that we keep moving towards God. By our own efforts, we cannot defeat Maya; only when we surrender completely to God, by His grace, we can cross the ocean of material existence. The next question in our mind would be, \u201cIf it is so easy to defeat Maya, then why is it that most of us fail?\u201d Shree Krishna has elaborated on that in the next verse."

Now He describes; the other four kinds who take refuge in Him.1.\u00a0The distressed. Those who find that their pot of worldly miseries is overflowing, and they are unable to cope with them conclude that it is futile running after the world. Thus, decide to take shelter in God. Similarly, those who find that the worldly supports fail to protect them; turn to God for protection. An apt example in the Mahabharata was Draupadi\u2019s surrender to Shree Krishna when Duryodhan and Dushasan tried to dishonor her in the courtroom of Hastinapur. Initially, she expected her husbands would protect her, but they did not. She pleaded the elders in the courtroom, Bheeshma, Vidur, Dhritarashtra, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. However, everyone remained speechless. When cruel Dushasan tried to disrobe her, she clenched her sari with her teeth and tried to protect her honor with her own strength. But her teeth could not hold on to the sari for long; they gave in to Dushasan\u2019s strength. She was helpless and finally called out to Shree Krishna for help. It was at this point that she surrendered completely to God and was not relying on anyone or her own strength for protection. Shree Krishna reciprocated immediately and intervened. Now, how much ever Dushasan pulled, Draupadi\u2019s sari kept extending, and very soon, there was a huge pile of cloth in the middle of the courtroom. Dushasan was unable to disrobe Draupadi; exhausted, he gave up. Such was the power of God\u2019s protection, but it came only when Draupadi surrendered completely.2.\u00a0The knowledge seekers. There are some people who have heard about the opulence of God and His spiritual realm. Thus, they are curious to know all about God and try to seek Him through knowledge.3. The seekers of worldly possessions. Some people are clear about what they want and take the shelter of God because they are convinced; that only God can provide what they are seeking. King Dhruv is an apt example. When Dhruv was a small boy, he felt neglected by his father, King Uttanapada. Disheartened, he went into the forest and did penance to please God. He wanted to become more powerful than his father. But as his devotion grew, he realized that God possessed the priceless jewel of divine love, and what he was seeking was like broken pieces of glass. Therefore, when pleased with his devotion, God gave him darshan, he requested the Lord to bestow upon him; self-less pure love.4.\u00a0Those situated in knowledge. Lastly, those souls who have understood the truth that they are tiny parts of God. Such people engage in devotion with the intent that it is their eternal duty to love and serve Him. Shree Krishna calls them the fourth kind of devotees."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishan says in this verse that those who are seeking God in distress, for worldly gains or out of curiosity, etc. are yet to possess selfless devotion. Gradually in the process of devotion, their hearts become pure, and they realize their eternal relationship with God. Then they develop selfless, exclusive, and incessant devotion toward Him. Now that they have the knowledge that the happiness of the world is temporary and God is the source of eternal bliss, they neither crave for favorable circumstances nor lament over reversals in the world. They become situated in selfless devotion with complete self-surrender. And for their Divine Beloved, they are willing to offer themselves as an offering in the fire of divine love. Shree Krishna declares that such devotees are dearest Him."

        "commentary": "In the previous verse, Shree Krishna stated that the devotees situated in knowledge or j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b bhakt\u00a0are the highest. However, He clarifies in this verse that whatever may be the reason for their devotion, all His devotees are privileged; even the other three kinds are blessed souls. But the devotees seated in knowledge worship God selflessly, without expecting any material gains in return. Hence, the unconditional love of such selfless devotees even binds God.Worldly love; is driven by the desire for self-gratification. There is a give and take attitude, and there is an expectation of receiving something in return from the beloved. However, Par\u0101 bhakti or divine love is totally different. It is filled with the desire for the happiness of the Divine Beloved and sacrifice in His service. Divine love fosters a giving attitude without expecting anything in return.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:k\u0101mera t\u0101tparya nija-sambhoga kevalak\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a-sukha-t\u0101tparya-m\u0101tra prema ta\u2019 prabalaataeva k\u0101ma-preme bahuta antarak\u0101ma andha-tama\u1e25, prema nirmala bh\u0101skara(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela, 4.166 & 171)[v16]\u201cLust (worldly love) exists for self-happiness; divine love is harbored for Shree Krishna\u2019s happiness. There is a tremendous difference between them\u2014lust is like darkness and ignorance, while divine love is pure and illuminating.\u201dJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has very beautifully stated:brahma lok paryanta sukh, aru muktihu\u00f1 sukh ty\u0101g,tabai dharahu paga prema patha, nahi\u1e45 lagi jaihe\u00f1 d\u0101g.(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 45)[v17]\u201cGive up the desires for worldly pleasures and that of liberation if you wish to walk the path of devotion. Else the pure waters of divine love will get tainted with selfishness.\u201dSage Narad defined pure devotion in this manner:tat sukha sukhitvam\u00a0 \u00a0 (N\u0101rad Bhakti Dar\u015bhan,\u00a0S\u016btra\u00a024)[v18]\u201cTrue love is for the happiness of the Beloved.\u201d The materially motivated devotees cannot engage in such devotion, but the devotee who is in knowledge rises to this level of selflessness. When someone learns to love God in this manner, he becomes a slave of that Devotee. The highest quality of God is\u00a0bhakta vatsalt\u0101\u00a0(his love for his devotees).\u00a0The Pura\u1e47as state:g\u012btv\u0101 cha mama n\u0101m\u0101ni vicharenmama sannidhauiti brav\u012bmi te satya\u1e41 kr\u012btoha\u1e41 tasya ch\u0101rjuna\u00a0(\u0100di Pur\u0101\u1e47 1.2.231)[v19]Shree Krishna says: \u201cI become the slave of those devotees of mine, who chant my names and keep me close to them in their thoughts; this is a fact, O Arjun.\u201dIn this verse Shree Krishna goes to the extent of saying that bound by the devotion and love of His selfless devotees, He looks upon them as Himself."

        "commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna clears this common perception of the intellectually inclined people that bhakti (devotion) is inferior to j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge). They are disdainful towards people engaged in devotion. They look down upon them and consider themselves to be superior as they are engaged in the brainy act of acquiring knowledge. Whereas, Shree Krishna declares that a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b spends several lifetimes cultivating knowledge and only when his or her j\u00f1\u0101na matures does he finally surrender to God. In fact, it is true knowledge that leads to devotion.Let us look at this example of a man who was walking on the beach.\u00a0 He steps upon an object on the sand and finds it to be a golden ring. He thinks of it as artificial jewellery worth $10, keeps it in his pocket, and forgets about it. After a few days, he remembers it and shows it to a friend, who is a goldsmith. He checks it and says, \u201cThis is pure gold and worth at least $500\u201d. The man feels thrilled to have found something precious and wears it every day. A few days pass by, and his uncle visits him, who is a jeweller. The uncle looks at the ring and says, \u201cThe stone on your gold ring is a precious diamond. Where did you get this? It costs more than $50,000.\u201d On hearing this, the man is overwhelmed and could not believe what his uncle just said. His uncle understood this and said, \u201cIt seems, you don\u2019t believe me, I am willing to pay you $40,000 for it.\u201d Now, the man feels elated as if he has won a lottery. He loves the diamond-studded gold ring much more, now that he knows its real value.This example demonstrates the direct relationship between knowledge and love. When the value of the ring was perceived by the man to be less, his love for it was also lesser as his knowledge of its value increased, the love for it, and the joy he got from it also kept increasing.\u00a0\u00a0The Ramayan states:j\u0101ne\u1e45 binu na hoi parat\u012bt\u012b, binu parat\u012bti hoi nahi\u1e45 pr\u012bt\u012b\u00a0[v20]\u201cWithout knowledge, there cannot be faith; without faith, love cannot grow.\u201dSimilarly, if someone has acquired true knowledge and claims to know the Brahman, then love for Him comes naturally. Else their knowledge is merely theoretical if they do not feel the love that fosters devotion.Shree Krishna says that j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs spend several lifetimes seeking true knowledge, and when their knowledge matures into true wisdom, that the Supreme Lord is all that is; they surrender to Him. However, He does not say this for the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs,\u00a0karm\u012bs, ha\u1e6dha-yogis,\u00a0ascetics, etc. He declares this for the devotees or such exalted souls who have realized \u201cGod is all that is\u201d and surrendered to Him. Nevertheless, such noble souls are very rare."

Hence, they forget that the Supreme Lord is the source of all that exists, including these celestial gods. As a president of a country appoints his officers among different departments. Similarly, these celestial gods also occupy different positions in the working of God\u2019s creation. They derive their powers from God; they are not independent of Him. They can bestow on their devotees only material things that are under their control. But cannot liberate anyone from the bondage of Maya or the cycle of birth and death because; they themselves are not liberated from this cycle. God alone has the power to do so. The celestial gods are also souls like us. However, they have attained these positions in the celestial abodes as a result of their pious deeds from previous lives. Once their account of pious deeds depletes, they have to return to earth. Hence, even the celestial gods are perishable; God alone is eternal."

        "commentary": "We find countless devotees around us engaging in devotion toward the celestial gods, with unflinching faith and wonder, how people develop such high faith in the lower form of worship? In this verse, Shree Krishna answers this and says that He is the creator of the faith in the celestial gods as well. When He finds people worshiping the devat\u0101s\u00a0for the fulfillment of their material desires, He helps them in their devotion and steadies their faith. The ability to create \u015bhraddh\u0101 or faith is beyond the capacity of the celestial gods; it is the indwelling Param\u0101tm\u0101\u00a0or the Supreme Soul who inspires faith in the hearts of the devotees.\u00a0 Later in the Bhagavad Gita verse 15.15, He states, \u201cI am seated in the hearts of all living beings, and from Me come memory, knowledge, as well as forgetfulness. I alone am to be known by all the Vedas, am the author of the Vedant, and the knower of the meaning of the Vedas.\u201dShree Krishna had earlier mentioned that those who are in true-knowledge engage in the highest and the most beneficial kind of \u015bhraddh\u0101\u00a0that is to worship the Supreme Lord. Then one might ask, why the Supreme Lord creates faith in people toward the celestial gods\u2014is it not inappropriate?Let us look at this example of parents giving dolls to their small children. The child plays with these dolls as if they were real people and develops love and affection towards them. The parents are aware of the child\u2019s innocence, yet they encourage this play to help the child develop the qualities of love, care, and affection towards other people. These qualities will help children become socially responsible when they grow up.Similarly, our eternal parent God is aware of our ignorance. Hence, when He finds that some souls engage in worship of the celestial gods for material gains, He helps them by steading their faith. He is aware that this experience will help in the evolution of the soul, and once they acquire true-knowledge that the Supreme Lord is the summum bonum or the highest good of everything, they will surrender to Him."

People who worship the devat\u0101s go to the planets of the respective\u00a0devat\u0101s upon death. Whereas, those who are devoted to me come to my abode.\u201d \u00a0Now, the question comes up again, when reaching God is the ultimate destination, then why does God steady the faith of those devotees who worship the celestial gods?Consider the example of our education system, where students start with primary school but cannot stay at that level forever. The teachers encourage them and coach them to move to the next level. Even though primary school is necessary, students outgrow that and keep moving higher and higher. Similarly, the Bhagavad Gita is not for the primary school students or the novices who wish to attain the celestial abodes. But for those devotees who are seeking a higher purpose.Since the devat\u0101s are perishable, the fruits they bestow on their devotees are also perishable. However, God is imperishable, and the fruits of his worship are also ever-lasting. Those who worship the eternal form of God, upon death, attain His eternal abode and stay there forever in His service."

        "commentary": "People often vehemently debate upon the Supreme Lord being a formless God, while the others claim He exists in His personal-form. Even those who agree to both aspects of God\u2019s personality are sometimes confused. Which of them precedes the other, and which of them is the original God? Did the personal form of God manifest from the formless, or is it the other way round? We have discussed this earlier in the commentary for Verse\u00a04.5.Here in this verse, Shree Krishna resolves this debate by stating that God exists in the spiritual realm eternally in His divine form. The ignorant do not understand the magnificent and imperishable nature of His personal-form. The divine personality of God has not manifested from the formless Brahman; it is primordial. The divine light that emanates from His transcendental body is the formless Brahman.The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:yannakhenduruchir brahma dhyeya\u1e41 brahm\u0101dibhi\u1e25 surai\u1e25gu\u1e47atrayamat\u012bta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 vande v\u1e5bind\u0101vane\u015bhvaram(Patal Khand 77.60) [v21]\u201cThe light that emanates from the toenails of God\u2019s personality is worshipped as\u00a0the Brahman\u00a0by the\u00a0j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs.\u201dTherefore, there is no difference between the two forms. Neither of them is superior or inferior. In God\u2019s personal-form, His name, form, virtues, abode, pastimes, associates, etc., manifest as an extension of His divine energy. However, in the formless Brahman, even though all the divine potencies and energies exist, they are in a concealed form."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna had mentioned two of His divine energies earlier in this chapter, in verses 7.4 and 7.5. The eight-fold prak\u1e5biti, or the material energy, and the\u00a0j\u012bva \u015bhakti, or the soul energy. Now, He talks about His third and the most powerful energy that is the Yogmaya.\u00a0 The Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:vi\u1e63h\u1e47u \u015bhakti\u1e25 par\u0101 prokt\u0101 k\u1e63hetraj\u00f1\u0101khy\u0101 tath\u0101 \u2019par\u0101avidy\u0101 karma sa\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101ny\u0101 t\u1e5bit\u012by\u0101 \u015bhaktiri\u1e63hyate(6.7.61) [v22]\u201cThe Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu has three main energies\u2014Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya.\u201dJagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:\u015bhaktim\u0101n k\u012b \u015bhaktiy\u0101\u00f1, aganita yadapi bakh\u0101natin maha\u00f1 \u2018m\u0101y\u0101, \u2018j\u012bva, aru, \u2018par\u0101, tri\u015bhakti pradh\u0101na(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 3) [v23]\u201cThe Supreme Energetic Shree Krishna has infinite energies. Amongst these,\u00a0Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya are the main ones.\u201dGod descends in this world by virtue of His Yogmaya energy and reveals His divine pastimes, His divine abode, His divine bliss and love on the Earth plane. However, the same Yogmaya power keeps His divinity veiled from us. We are unable to feel His presence, although He is seated in our hearts. Even in the present, if we are fortunate enough to see the Lord in His personal-form, we cannot recognize Him. Until we are eligible for His divine vision, the Yogmaya keeps God\u2019s divine form concealed from us. And only by God\u2019s grace, the Yogmaya bestows upon us the divine vision that allows us to recognize and see God.The Ramayan states:chid\u0101nandamaya deha tumh\u0101r\u012b, bigata bik\u0101ra j\u0101na adhik\u0101r\u012b\u00a0\u00a0[v24]\u201cO God, you have a divine form. Only those whose hearts are purified can know you by your grace.\u201dSimilar to God, His Yogmaya energy is both formless and manifests into personal forms. Radha, Sita, Lakshmi, Parvati. Durga, Kali, etc., are the divine forms of the Yogmaya energy of God. In the Vedic culture, all these forms are revered; as the Mother of the Universe. She radiates the motherly qualities of kindness, mercy, compassion, beauty, divine grace, and causeless love. Among these, the most important quality for us souls is Her divine grace with which we can acquire transcendental knowledge to know God. It is for the same reason, the devotees of Vrindavan sing, \u201cRadhe Radhe, Shyam se mil\u0101 de,\u201d\u00a0\u201cO Radha, please bestow your grace and help me meet Shree Krishna.\u201dTherefore, the same Yogmaya\u2013conceals God from the unqualified souls and bestows Her divine grace upon the surrendered souls, for they can know Him. However, those souls who are under the influence of Maya or the material energy turn their backs towards God. They remain bereft of the divine grace of His Yogmaya energy and continue living in ignorance, entangled in Maya. Others who have turned to God are in the shelter of Yogmaya and liberated from Maya."

Most of us are forgetful of even what we were thinking a few hours ago; whereas, God is omniscient. He remembers and keeps a record of the deeds, words, and even the thoughts of each individual soul of the universe throughout their life and since their infinite lifetimes. God maintains this record of the sa\u00f1chit\u00a0karma or the stockpile of karmas of every soul for endless lifetimes because, as the governor of the law of karma, He dispenses justice to the souls.Shree Krishna says that He has the knowledge of everything, the past, present, and the future.

Happiness and distress, pleasure and pain, summer and winter, night and day, etc., all these dualities exist in pairs. These dualities are an inseparable part of life\u2019s experiences. However, the most deluding dualities in life are birth and death. The arena of one\u2019s life exists between the two ends of birth and death. From the very moment a living creature is born, death is inevitable, and again comes a subsequent-birth.Our material intellect believes that worldly pleasures will give us happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, in material consciousness, while we desire the favorable ones, we detest the unpleasant experiences. Although attraction and aversion are not the inherent qualities of these dualities, they develop due to our ignorance. Our intellect does not realize that materially pleasurable situations will only increase our material illusion. Thus, it makes us believe that pain is detrimental to us. However, adversities have the potential of dispelling that material illusion from our mind and elevate our soul. Our ignorance is the root cause of our delusions. A spiritually elevated person accepts these dualities as inseparable aspects of God\u2019s creation and rises above likes and dislikes, attraction and aversion, etc."

        "commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna mentions that those enlightened souls who know Him are truly devoted to Him, and even at the time of their death, they are in full consciousness of Him. Such true devotees attain His divine abode. But how can one remember God even at the time of death? Death is said to be a very painful journey, comparable to 2000 scorpions biting at the same time. Such extreme pain is beyond the tolerance of any normal human; a person loses consciousness; the mind and the intellect stop working much before the end. One cannot remember anything in that state. Where is the question of remembering God? How do they do it then?Those enlightened beings who have attained true knowledge are ever filled with devotion to God, their mind and intellect, all surrendered and attached to Him alone. Thus, their bodies are beyond pleasure and pain even at the time of death. Their soul is completely disconnected from lamentation and hankering at the material level because it is no longer in bodily consciousness. \u00a0Shree Krishna has explained the words adhibh\u016bta, adhidaiva, and adhiyaj\u00f1a in the next chapter."

        "commentary": "The Vedas address God by several names; Brahman is one of them. In this verse, Shree Krishna says to Arjun that the Supreme Entity is called the Brahman. Time, space, the chain of cause and effect, etc., are all characteristics of the material realm. However, the Brahman is beyond these, as He is transcendental to the material plane. He is described as aksharam or indestructible because He is unaffected by the changes in the universe.\u00a0The Brihadaranyak Upanishad 3.8.8 states,\u00a0\u201cLearned people speak of Brahman as\u00a0akshar\u00a0(indestructible).\u00a0 It is also designated as\u00a0Param\u00a0(Supreme) because It possesses qualities beyond those possessed by maya and the souls.\u201dThe word adhyatma has two meanings in Sanskrit. One is the science of the soul, and the second is the path to spirituality. However, here Shree Krishna has used it for one\u2019s own self that includes the body, mind, and intellect.Karmas are fruitive activities performed by a person. It is these karmas that forge every individual\u2019s distinct conditions of existence in various lifetimes. They keep the soul circling in samsara or the cycle of material existence."

        "commentary": "The universe is a kaleidoscope of all the physical manifestations of the five elements of nature: earth, water, fire, air, and space. This ever-changing universe is called adhibhuta. Although the devatas or the celestial gods administer the different departments of the universe, God has sovereignty, even over the devatas. He is Vir\u0101\u1e6d Purusha, the complete cosmic personality who encompasses the entire material creation. Hence, God is called Adhidaiva.\u00a0Shree Krishna says that as the Supreme Soul or Paramatma,\u00a0He dwells in the hearts of all living beings of the universe. He is the one who bestows rewards for all our actions and the presiding divinity for all the yajna (sacrifices). Thus, He is also called Adhiyajna, or the Lord of all sacrifices. Therefore, all yajna should be performed; for the satisfaction of this Supreme Divine Personality.So far, Shree Krishna has answered six out of the seven questions concerning the meanings of the various terms Arjun had asked at the beginning of this chapter. In the next few verses, Shree Krishna will answer Arjun\u2019s seventh question regarding the moment of death."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna states in this verse, whatever thoughts prominently dominate a person\u2019s mind at the moment of death determine his or her next birth. However, one should not conclude that God-realization can be attained merely by meditating upon God at the time of death. When we plan our travel, it requires careful planning and execution beforehand; we cannot make our plans after we pack our baggage.For example, with a lot of effort, one may teach their pet parrot to say \u201cHello\u201d or \u201cHave a good day.\u201d However, if someone attacks the parrot, it forgets all that it has learnt, and screeches in its natural sound of \u201cTe-Te.\u201d Likewise, the channels of thoughts that we create through lifelong habit, at the time of death, the same thoughts will naturally flow into our mind. What we constantly contemplate and meditate upon throughout our life are influenced by our daily habits and associations. Therefore, it is natural that these would continue to determine our final thoughts.The Puranas tell a story of an illustrious King Bharat. He renounced his kingdom to pursue God-realization and was living an ascetics life in the forest. Once, he was meditating and saw a deer jump into a nearby river. She was pregnant and escaping an attacking tiger. Out of fear, she delivered the baby in the flowing water. She had no chance to rescue her new-born and crossed over to the other side of the river. Witnessing this entire episode, Bharat felt pity for the baby deer that was floating in the river. He rescued the fawn and took it to his hut. He started raising it with great affection. Collecting green grass and feeding it, keeping it warm by hugging it, and watching its frolicking, gave Bharat a lot of pleasure.Slowly, Bharat spent his entire day taking care of the fawn. His mind became totally absorbed in its thoughts and away from God. Thus, even when he was about to die, he was only concerned about the fawn and called out to it in fond remembrance. As a result, King Bharat was born as a deer in his next life. Nevertheless, because of his spiritual sadhana from his previous lives, even in a deer\u2019s body, he was aware of the mistakes he had committed in his past life. Hence even as a deer, Bharat spent his entire life near pious ashrams of saints in the forest. And when he died, he was granted human birth again. This time, Bharat did not waste his chance and completed his sadhana. Eventually, he attained God-realization and came to be known as the great sage Jadabharat.Death is a very painful experience. Therefore, it is natural that the mind gravitates toward those thoughts that are part of one\u2019s inherent nature. According to the Skand Puran, thinking of God at the moment of death is exceedingly difficult. Hence, for the mind to always think of God requires our inner nature to be one with Him. The consciousness that abides within our mind and intellect is our inner nature. And whatever thoughts we contemplate continuously manifest as part of our inner nature. Therefore, we must practice remembering God at every moment of our life. Only then will we develop a God-conscious inner nature. In the next verse, Lord Krishna advises the same to Arjun."

        "commentary": "The essence of the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita is in the first line of this verse. It has the power to make your life divine. It reiterates the definition of karma yoga and applies to people from all walks of life. Shree Krishna says to Arjun, \u201cDo your duty with your body, and keep your mind attached to Me.\u201d As a warrior, Arjun must fight; that is his duty. However, the Lord says to Arjun that even in the middle of a battle, one should remember God. The same message is for everyone\u2014be it farmers, engineers, doctors, students, homemakers, or any other professional.\u00a0People often disregard their worldly duties and responsibilities with the pretext of leading a spiritual life. On the other hand, some give an excuse of their worldly engagements for not practicing spirituality. They perceive that both material and spiritual goals; cannot be pursued concurrently. But Shree Krishna\u2019s message in this verse defies all these myths and can sanctify our entire life.In the practice of karma yoga, the body is engaged in worldly work, but the mind is attached to God. Hence, while we work to fulfil our worldly duties, these works are not bound by the Law of Karma. Works; that are performed with attachment result in karmic reactions. In the absence of attachment, one is not considered guilty even in the worldly laws.Let us take an example of a man apprehended for killing a pedestrian in a road accident. In the court, when the judge questioned him if he killed the pedestrian, the man agreed. The judge said, \u201cThen you are guilty of murder and will get punished accordingly.\u201d To this, the man said, \u201cSir, I agree I killed the pedestrian, but I had no intention to kill, it was an accident.\u201d He further explained, \u201cYour honour, I was driving on the appropriate side of the road, the lights were green, and my car was within the speed limits. I was alert, and my car was also in perfect condition. However, this man came suddenly in front of my car, although I applied the brakes, my car hit him, and he died immediately.\u201d On hearing this, the judge let him off without any punishment, as it was established that the incident was an accident and this man had no intention to kill.The above example illustrates that even in the material world, one is not held liable for actions taken without attachment to results. Similarly, in the spiritual world, the Law of Karma holds the same principle.In the Mahabharat war, Arjun fulfiled his duties as a warrior. He fought valiantly without any attachments to worldly gain. He followed Shree Krishna\u2019s instructions and kept his mind constantly attached to God. Therefore, at the end of the war, Shree Krishna declared that Arjun had not accrued any bad karma. As per the Law of Karma: when someone performs their duties without any selfish attachment to the world, with their mind always in God, such actions get multiplied by zero. When you multiply even a million with zero, the result will always be a zero.This verse clearly defines the condition for karma yoga: Do your worldly duties, but your mind should always be thinking of God. The very instant we forget God, our mind is taken over by the mighty commanders of maya\u2019s army\u2014desire, envy, greed, lust, anger, hatred, etc. Therefore, it is necessary that we keep our mind always attached to God.Some people claim to be karma yogis because they practice both karma and yoga. Every day they do their worldly duties, which they call their karma, and a few minutes of yoga, by meditating on God. However, this is not the definition of karma yoga given by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. He says that in karma yoga, there are only two conditions:1) While doing any work, the mind should always be thinking of God.2) The remembrance of God should be constant throughout the day and not intermittent.This famous couplet by Saint Kabir beautifully expresses this concept:sumiran k\u012b sudhi yo\u1e45 karo, jyau\u1e45 g\u0101gar panih\u0101rabolat dolat surati me\u1e45, kahe kab\u012bra vich\u0101r\u201cRemember God just as the village woman remembers the water pot on her head. She speaks with others and walks on the path, but her hand keeps holding onto the pot.\u201dIn the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the benefits of practicing karma yoga."

        "commentary": "Lord Krishna has reiterated this instruction to always engage the mind in meditating upon God several times in the Bhagavad Gita itself. Verses 8.14, 10.10, 12.8, etc., emphasize the same concept.In this verse, Shree Krishna uses the word abhy\u0101sa, which means to practice. He says that we must train our mind and form a habit of always meditating upon God. This practice is not to be done at fixed times or regular intervals but continuously as part of our daily life alongside our worldly activities throughout the day.We must remember that it is not the actions that we are performing with our body but where we are placing our mind that will shape our future. While performing our worldly duties, if we attach our mind to God, who is all pure, our mind will also get purified.When one is continuously engaging in devotion, with complete surrender to God, their purified mind will gradually get fully absorbed in God-consciousness. Such souls receive the divine grace of God that liberates them from the bondage of maya. Then God bestows upon these souls His unlimited divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. They become God-realized while they are still alive and live a complete life. Eventually, when they die, their soul ascends to the Divine Abode of God."

Therefore, one can meditate on any one or all of them. Such meditation, where we attach our mind to the Supreme Divinity, takes our mind to the divine realm, and as a result, it purifies.In this verse, Shree Krishna has mentioned eight such divine aspects of God:1.\u00a0Kavi: Like a poet who knows the entirety of his creation, God is omniscient. He is the seer who knows the past, present, and future, as mentioned in verse 7.26.2.\u00a0Pur\u0101\u1e47am:\u00a0 God is the most ancient, and nothing predates Him.

He is the creator, and everything in this universe is under His control and run by His law.4.\u00a0A\u1e47ora\u1e47\u012by\u0101n: Here God is said to exist in the subtlest or subatomic form. The soul is subtler than matter, but God is even subtler than the soul, as He is seated within every soul.5.\u00a0Sarvasya Dh\u0101t\u0101: God is the source of sustenance. Similar to an ocean that sustains the waves and its vast marine ecology. God is the support for His entire creation.6.\u00a0Achintya r\u016bpa: God exists in inconceivable forms. Our mind and intellect are material in nature, and God is divine, thus, beyond our understanding. It is only through His grace one can understand Him. He bestows His divine grace and makes our mind divine by His Yogmaya power; only then can we know Him.7.\u00a0\u0100ditya var\u1e47a: \u00a0\u0100ditya is one of the names of the sun god. Here, God is said to be dazzling like the sun.8.\u00a0Tamasa\u1e25 Parast\u0101t: Similar to the sun that eradicates darkness, God with His effulgence eliminates ignorance. On a cloudy day, the sun is not visible, but it is an optical illusion for us. The sun is where it is, unaffected by the clouds in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Similarly, during His Leelas or pastimes, God may seem to be covered by His material energy, Maya. However, He is unaffected by it. \u00a0He is beyond darkness and ignorance.\u00a0One may ask, why so much variety. Western scholars often get confused by the various philosophies, paths, and instructions given in the Vedic scriptures. Therefore, it is stressed in the Hindu scriptures to study them under the guidance of an able Guru.We all have different choices and natures according to our\u00a0sansk\u0101rs\u00a0(tendencies) from endless lifetimes. Consider this example of two people going into a cloth shop. The chances of both of them buying the same type, color, or style of clothes is very rare. Therefore, the shops keep a variety of clothes and cater to the choices and preferences of people. Similarly, the Vedic scriptures also offer various spiritual paths so that based on the level of sadhana that we may have performed in our past lives, we may choose a suitable path. However, they simultaneously stress on bhakti or devotion to God that ties together all these paths in one common thread.The Bhagavad Gita beautifully embraces varieties of sadhanas to cater to a large populace belonging to diverse backgrounds, upbringing, and natures. Bhakti involves focusing the mind upon God, in His various divine Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, etc. In its pure form, bhakti is called \u015bhuddha bhakti. However, when undertaken along with\u00a0ashtanga yoga, it is termed yog-mi\u015bhra bhakti or a fusion of devotion and\u00a0ashtanga yoga sadhana.Shree Krishna has described yog-mi\u015bhra bhakti from verse ten to thirteen. In the practice of ashtanga yoga, the life force or pr\u0101n shakti is channelized through su\u1e63hum\u1e47\u0101 n\u0101di of the spinal column and then raised toward the third eye region between the eyebrows. In this verse, He says that at the time of death, one who performs this with great devotion and complete focus on the Divine Lord will definitely achieve Him."

The B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had states:etasya v\u0101 ak\u1e63harasya pra\u015bh\u0101sane g\u0101rgis\u016bry\u0101chandramasau vidh\u1e5bitau ti\u1e63h\u1e6dhata\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3.8.9)\u201cUnder the mighty control of the Imperishable, the sun and the moon are held on their course.\u201dShree Krishna mentions in this verse the word sangrahe\u1e47a,\u00a0which means \u201cin brief.\u201d He says that this path is very difficult to follow and not suitable for everyone. Therefore, He will not elaborate much and briefly describe this path of yog-mi\u015bhr\u0101 bhakti; that leads to attaining the formless aspect of God. It demands living a life of rigid continence and perform severe austerities. Renouncing worldly desires and practicing brahmacharya, a vow of celibacy. As was previously detailed in verse 6.14, the practice of celibacy conserves a person\u2019s physical energy. This energy, when channelized through sadhana, gets transformed into spiritual energy. It also enhances the intellect and memory power of the s\u0101dhaks (spiritual aspirants) and helps them comprehend the spiritual subjects better."

Therefore, a practitioner of meditation should guard himself against the incessant stream of worldly thoughts that the unrestrained senses can create. Locking the world out by restraining the mind and the senses; is most essential in meditation.In this verse, Shree Krishna uses the words sarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i-sanyamya, which mean guarding the gates of the body, and h\u1e5bidi nirudhya\u00a0that means \u201clocking the mind in the heart.\u201d He says that by controlling the passages that enter the body, one can lock the mind in the heart. Restricting the senses from their natural tendencies and directing the mind toward ak\u1e63haram\u00a0the imperishable Supreme Lord.

        "commentary": "The Vedic scriptures state that at the beginning of creation, God first created sound. With sound, He created space and then continued with the rest of the creation process.\u00a0 That primordial sound was the sacred syllable OM it is also called Pranav\u2014the sound manifestation of the Brahman. It represents the formless aspect of the Supreme Lord, without any attributes and virtues.The Bible also mentions this in John 1:1: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.The sound Om pervades the entire creation; it is imperishable and infinite like God Himself. Hence, it is also called an\u0101hat n\u0101d. In the Vedic philosophy, it is conferred as the mah\u0101 v\u0101kya, or the Great Sound Vibration of the Vedas and often attached to the beginning of the Vedic mantras, as b\u012bja (seed or core)\u00a0mantra similar to hr\u012b\u1e41, kl\u012b\u1e41,\u00a0etc.For proper chanting of the sacred word OM, the emphasis is on the vibrations of three letters: A\u2026\u00a0U\u2026\u00a0M\u2026 One starts by making an \u201cA\u201d sound from the belly, with an open mouth and throat; it then merges into a \u201cU\u201d created in the middle of the mouth. Finally, it ends in chanting \u201cM\u201d with a closed mouth.Devotees consider the word Om as the impersonal form of God. In ashtanga yoga, the Pra\u1e47av sound is considered the object of meditation. In this verse, Shree Krishna is describing the process of meditation with regard to the ashtanga yoga sadhana.\u00a0He states that to focus the mind on God, one should chant \u201c\u00d3m\u201d while practicing austerities and maintaining the vow of celibacy.However, the devotees who take the path of bhakti yoga prefer to meditate upon the personal Names of the Lord. They experience greater sweetness in God\u2019s bliss when they meditate on; the personal Name and Forms of God, such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, etc.If you compare; the pleasure experienced by two ladies, one who is an expectant mother and one who has her new-born baby in her lap. The experience is much sweeter for the new mother. Seeing her beautiful baby, she even forgets the discomfort and pain she had experienced during childbirth.The time of death is the final test of our meditation. As death is said to be intensely painful and despite the pain, those who are able to focus on God even at that last moment; attain Him. And on leaving the body, their souls reach His divine abode. However, to achieve such a state is very difficult; it requires continuous practice throughout one\u2019s life. The merciful Lord Krishna shows us an easier path in the next verse."

        "commentary": "In the previous verse, Shree Krishna had explained the process of meditation as per ashtanga yoga sadhana to focus on the formless God, devoid of any attributes. However, this practice is not only difficult but also very bland. Therefore, He suggests an alternative method, that is, to meditate upon the personal forms of God such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, Vishnu, etc., including their Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates. This method is simpler and helps in keeping the mind absorbed in God and His divine form.For the first time in the Bhagavad Geeta, Shree Krishna says that He is easy to attain. But only to those yogis who are ananya-chet\u0101\u1e25, which means their mind is absorbed exclusively in God. The word a-nanya Etymologically means\u00a0na anya, or \u201cno other.\u201d Thus, exclusive devotion is the precondition for attaining God.\u00a0Throughout the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has stressed upon exclusive devotion and surrender to attain Him.anany\u0101\u015bh chintayanto m\u0101\u1e41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09.22tam eva \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 gachchha\u00a0\u00a0\u00a018.62m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja\u00a0\u00a0\u00a018.66Other Vedic scriptures also reiterate the same message:m\u0101m ekam eva \u015bhara\u1e47am \u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 sarva-dehin\u0101m\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Bhagavatam 11.12.15)\u201cSurrender to Me alone, who am the Supreme Soul of all living beings.\u201deka bharoso eka bala ek \u0101sa visv\u0101sa\u00a0\u00a0 (Ramayan)\u201cI have only one support, one strength, one faith, one shelter, and that is Shree Ram.\u201dany\u0101\u015bhray\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 ty\u0101go \u2019nanyat\u0101\u00a0\u00a0 (N\u0101rad Bhakti Dar\u015bhan,\u00a0S\u016btra\u00a010)\u201cReject all other shelters, and become exclusive to God.\u201dMany spiritual seekers love God and try hard to attain Him, but their mind is also attached to the material world, their family, friends, pets, house, assets, etc. They contemplate upon God to purify their mind, but when they go back to their worldly relations, it gets dirty again. The worldly attachments are not only binding but also imperfect, thus cause impurity of the mind. It is like applying soap to a dirty cloth, cleaning it with pure water, and putting it back into unclean water. Thus, all the effort goes futile.The ultimate aim of sadhana is to purify the mind, which can only be done by attaching the mind to God, who is all-pure. In this verse, Shree Krishna says that it is not just devotion; but exclusive devotion; that is necessary to attain Him. Exclusive devotion is attainable only when a purified mind is absorbed in the Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God."

        "commentary": "What happens when one attains God? Once God-realized the soul is liberated from the cycle of life and death, it reaches the divine abode of God and remains there forever. It does not take birth in the material world again and suffer its miseries. Life in the material world from birth till death is full of suffering.The struggle starts inside the mother\u2019s womb itself, where we hang upside down for nine months. Then we go through a painful process of taking birth and delivered into an unknown world, where we have to cry for our every need. As we grow, we need to learn to speak, eat, walk, etc. Then comes the turmoil of adolescence, which is a mentally challenging phase. As adults, marriage and relationships test our endurance and patience to accept and accommodate individualities. We struggle to maintain social responsibilities. Then comes old age with its gifts of sickness and disease. All through our life, we suffer from pain and miseries; induced by our own body, mind, people, or circumstances around us. Then finally, we die, which is again an extremely painful experience.But why does God put us through so much pain and misery? In God\u2019s grand design, the purpose of these miseries is to realize that the material realm is not the permanent abode for the soul. It serves as a correction home for the souls who have forgotten God and are trapped in the material world. These sufferings and miseries help the souls develop the desire for God. Consider an example of a person who accidentally puts his hand on burning coal. Immediately, due to the burning sensation and pain he experiences, he withdraws his hand.What really happened here? When the man touched hot coal, his skin started burning, and the neurons on his skin sent a message to the brain of the pain he experienced. The brain immediately sends commands to his hand muscles that remove his hand to avoid further burning and pain. Therefore, pain is a signal that something is not right and needs correction. Similarly, the pain and miseries that we experience in the material world; are stimulation for us to shun our defective consciousness. These inspire and motivate the lost souls to tread toward their ultimate goal of union with God.Those worthy souls who commit themselves in exclusive devotion attain God and reach His Divine Abode. However, those souls who remain engrossed in material affluence and forget God continue to rotate in the cycle of birth and death. Eventually, we get what we make ourselves worthy of and the endeavours we choose to undertake."

        "commentary": "According to the Vedic scriptures, there are fourteen worlds in our universe. Seven planes of existence beginning with earth and higher \u2014bh\u016b\u1e25, bhuva\u1e25, swa\u1e25, maha\u1e25, jana\u1e25, tapa\u1e25, satya\u1e25. The higher planes are the celestial abodes called the Swarga. The remaining seven planes that are lower than earth are the hellish abodes called\u00a0narak.\u00a0These are \u2014tal, atal, vital, sutal, tal\u0101tal, ras\u0101tal, p\u0101t\u0101l.\u00a0Similar references are made by other religions as well. Islam mentions the seventh sky or the s\u0101tv\u0101\u00f1 \u0101sm\u0101n as the highest of the seven heavens. The Talmud, the book of Jewish law and theology, has also enumerated seven heavens, the highest being Araboth.These fourteen planes of existence are called the lokas or various worlds of our universe. The satya\u1e25 lok, also known as Brahma Lok, the abode of Brahma is the highest among them, and p\u0101t\u0101l lok is the lowest. However, all these lokas are under the realm of Maya, the material energy of God. Hence, the dwellers of all the fourteen lokas go through the cycle of birth and death. It is because of their impermanent nature Shree Krishna in the previous verse called these worlds to be a\u015bh\u0101\u015bhvatam (temporary) and du\u1e25kh\u0101layam\u00a0(full of misery).All those who are born in these lokas of material existence are subject to death someday. Even the king of the celestial gods, Indra, has to die.The Puranas mention an incident where Indra ordered the celestial architect, Vishwakarma, to construct a huge palace for himself in Swarga. \u00a0However, the extension plan kept on increasing, and the construction was not ending. Vishwakarma got weary and prayed to God for help. God visited Indra and enquired, \u201cHow many Vishwakarmas have you engaged in constructing such a huge palace?\u201d Indra was surprised by God\u2019s question because he thought there was only one Vishwakarma. Smiling, God said to Indra, \u201cSimilar to this universe with its fourteen worlds, there are infinite universes. And each universe has an Indra and a Vishwakarma\u201d.At the same time, Indra saw several ants walking toward him in queues. Surprised, he asked God; where all these ants were coming from. God said, \u201cAll these ants were Indras in their past lives; I have called them to meet you.\u201d Indra was speechless.Soon after, a revered sage, Rishi Lomash, visited Indra. He was carrying a straw mat on his head and had a circle of hair on his chest. However, there were gaps in that circle, made by fallen hair. Indra received the sage respectfully and then asked him politely; why he was carrying a mat on his head? Also, what does the hair on his chest signify?The Rishi said, \u201cI am blessed with a boon, to be chir\u0101yu (endless life). The hair on my chest signifies life on this universe. Whenever the tenure of an Indra ends, one hair falls. And several such falls have caused the gaps in my chest hair.\u201d Indra was astonished. Lomash Rishi then added, \u201cI carry this mat on my head because during the day it protects me from sun and rain. Also, I spread it on the ground at night and sleep. My disciples want to build a permanent residence for me to stay. But I think, when life itself is temporary, why build a house here?\u201d Hearing this from someone who has the lifespan of many Indras; humbled Indra. His pride shattered, he thought to himself, \u201cWhat is the point in building such a huge palace, if someday, I have to leave it all and go?\u201d He asked Vishwakarma to stop the construction immediately and released him.It is marvellous how these stories from the Puranas and the Bhagavad Gita give an insight into; cosmology of the universe. Amazingly, these scriptures were written in ancient times, several thousand years ahead of modern astronomy. It was only in the sixteenth century that a western scientist, Nicholas Copernicus, first proposed a heliocentric theory stating that; the sun was the centre of the universe. This theory changed the previous belief that the earth was the centre of the universe.Further advancement in astronomy revealed that even the sun was not the centre of the universe. It was part of a galaxy called the milky way having countless stars like our sun, each with its own solar system. And all stars, along with their solar systems, are revolving around the epicentre of the galaxy. Further research has revealed; that similar to the Milky Way, several galaxies are gyrating in our universe.However, the Vedic philosophy states that the earth or the\u00a0Bh\u016br Lok is revolving around\u00a0Swar Lok, and the realm between them is Bhuvar Lok. The Swar Lok is again moving around Jana Lok, and the realm between these two is the Mahar Lok. Jana Lok is also not stationary and is circling the Brahma Lok (Satya Lok), and Tapa Lok is the realm between them. These are the seven higher planes, and similarly, there are seven lower planes as well. It is incredible; that our Vedic scholars had such insight into the subject over five thousand years ago.In this verse, Shree Krishna states that all the fourteen worlds of this universe are within the realm of His material energy Maya. Hence, the occupants are subject to the cycle of birth and death. Only those who attain God-realization get liberated from the clutches of maya. Upon death, they leave their material bodies and go to His divine abode to stay there forever. They receive divine bodies and participate in the divine Pastimes of God eternally. \u00a0They need not take birth in the material world. However, some saints and pious souls come back to the material world. Although liberated, they do so to engage in the divine welfare of humankind. These pious souls are the great Masters and Prophets. They descend on earth to help others get out of the bondage of maya and guide them on the path toward God-realization."

        "commentary": "The Vedic cosmological system has measurements of time that are vast and astounding. Consider this example of an insect, that is, born at night and within the same night it grows, procreates, lays eggs, and grows old. The next morning, you find it dead under the street light. If one tells that insect that its entire lifespan was only equal to one night of a human, that will be unbelievable for the insect. Similarly, the measurements of time given in the Vedas are beyond normal human imagination.The Vedas state that one year on the earth equals; one day and night of Indra and other celestial gods. Thus, one year of the celestial gods consisting of 12 x 30 days equals 360 years on the earth plane. The calculation goes much further; 12,000 years of the celestial gods makes one mah\u0101 yug\u00a0(cycle of four\u00a0yugas) on the earth plane, that is, 4.32 million years.\u00a0Following is the Vedic calculation of time periods or yugas on the earth plane:Kali Yug: 432,000 yearsDw\u0101par Yug: 864,000 yearsTret\u0101 Yug: 1,296,000 yearsSatya Yug: 1,728,000 yearsMah\u0101 Yug: 4,320,000 years (Adding the four yugas)Kalp: 4,320,000,000 years (1000 Mah\u0101 Yug = 1 day of Brahma)One thousand mah\u0101 yug make one day of Brahma, called a kalp, and then there is Brahma\u2019s night of equal duration. Kalp is the largest unit of time in the world; it equals 4.32 billion years. In this verse, Shree Krishna states that only those who understand this knowledge truly know what day and night are.According to Vedas, the duration of the universe equals Brahma\u2019s lifespan, of 100 years. Brahma\u2019s one day and night put together make 8.64 billion earth years, and 36,000 such days of his lifespan would make 311 trillion 40 billion years. So, that will be one life cycle of our universe. Now the question arises; when Brahma is a creator, why is he also subject to birth and death?Brahma is also a soul; who has reached tremendously elevated consciousness. Thus, God has given him the position of Brahma, to discharge the duties as a creator on God\u2019s behalf. But like all other living creatures, Brahma is also under the cycle of life and death. However, at the end of his tenure, he is liberated and goes to the Abode of God. Sometimes, at the creation of the world, when God does not find any eligible souls for the position of Brahma, God Himself becomes Brahma."

        "commentary": "The cosmic play of the various planes of existence in the universe is astounding. The fourteen worlds and their planetary systems undergo repeated cycles of s\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e6di, sthiti,\u00a0and\u00a0pralaya (creation, preservation, and dissolution). All planetary systems, up to the Mahar Lok, are destroyed at the end of a kalp; that is Brahma\u2019s day of 4.32 billion years. This partial dissolution is called naimittik pralaya. When Shukdev Paramhans narrated the Shrimad Bhagavatam to Parikshit, he stated that Brahma creates these worlds similar to a child playing with his toys. A child builds structures with his toys during the day and pulls them apart before going to bed at night. Similarly, when Brahma wakes up, he creates the planetary systems and their life forms and dissolves them before going to sleep.The entire universe dissolves at the end of Brahma\u2019s life of 100 years (311.04 trillion earth years). The whole material creation winds up. The\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-mah\u0101bh\u016bta\u00a0merge into the\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s, the\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s\u00a0merge into\u00a0ahank\u0101r,\u00a0ahank\u0101r\u00a0merges into\u00a0mah\u0101n, and\u00a0mah\u0101n\u00a0merges into\u00a0prak\u1e5biti. Prak\u1e5biti\u00a0is the subtle form of Maya, the material energy of God.\u00a0Maya now takes up her primordial form. She goes back into the body of the Supreme Lord, Maha Vishnu. This great dissolution is called pr\u0101k\u1e5bit pralaya, or\u00a0mah\u0101pralaya. When it is time for the next cycle\u00a0of creation, Maha Vishnu glances at prak\u1e5biti, and by His mere glance, prak\u1e5biti starts unfolding herself again. From\u00a0prak\u1e5biti,\u00a0mah\u0101n\u00a0is created, from\u00a0mah\u0101n,\u00a0ahank\u0101r; then from\u00a0ahank\u0101r,\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s\u00a0are created; from\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s,\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-mah\u0101bh\u016bta\u00a0get created.\u00a0 And by this process, unlimited universes are created again.According to modern science, there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. And similar to the Milky Way, there are over a billion galaxies in the universe. Thus, scientists have concluded that in our universe, there are more than 10^20 stars. However, the Vedas state that, similar to our universe, there are infinite universes of various sizes and different features. These universes manifest from the body of Maha Vishnu. Every time He breathes in infinite universes are created from the pores of His divine body. And when He breathes out, they dissolve again. Thus, one breath of Maha Vishnu is equal to 100 years of Brahma\u2019s life. Also, all these universes have their own Brahma, Vishnu, and Shankar. In the innumerable universes, there are innumerable Brahmas, Vishnus, and Shankars. The entire creation originates from Maha Vishnu, and\u00a0at dissolution, merges back into Him."

        "commentary": "God is present everywhere. The same Supreme Lord who resides in the spiritual sky in His divine abode, at the same time, is seated in the hearts of every living creature. He is all-pervading and present in every atom of the material world. It is not that He is a hundred percent God in His personal form and ten percent when He is in our hearts or anywhere else in the material world. God exists a hundred percent in all His forms. Due to our ignorance, we are unable to recognize His presence within us or all around us.Sage Shandilya states in his Bhakti Darshan:gav\u0101\u1e41 sarpi\u1e25 \u015bhar\u012brastha\u1e41 na karotya\u1e45ga po\u1e63ha\u1e47am\u201cMilk resides in the body of the cow, but it does not benefit the health of the cow, which is weak and sick.\u201d\u00a0When the same milk is converted to yogurt and fed to the cow with a little black pepper, it cures the cow; of its illness.Likewise, it is difficult to develop devotion for an omnipresent or all-pervading God. Worshiping Him in His divine form helps us purify our heart, which is necessary to attract His divine grace. Because, to perceive God\u2019s divinity, we need our senses to be divine. By His grace, His divine energy Yogmaya instills in us divine senses, mind, and intellect so that we could know both His all-pervading aspect and His personal form. Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna declares that only through bhakti can we know Him.In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has repeatedly emphasized upon the need for bhakti to know God and attain Him. The verse 6.47 states: Shree Krishna considers those engaged in devotion as the highest in position among His devotees. However, in this verse, Shree Krishna explicitly adds the term ananyay\u0101, which means \u201cby no other path\u201d can one know God.\u00a0Chaitanya Mahaprabhu very nicely said:bhakti mukha nir\u012bk\u1e63haka karm yoga j\u00f1\u0101na (Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, Madhya 22.17)\u201cAlthough\u00a0karma, jnana, and ashtanga yoga\u00a0are also pathways to God-realization, all these require the support of bhakti for their fulfillment.\u201d\u00a0Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj also said:karm yog aru j\u00f1\u0101na saba, s\u0101dhana yadapi bakh\u0101npai binu bhakti sabai janu, m\u1e5bitaka deha binu pr\u0101n(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 8)\u201cAlthough\u00a0karma, jnana, and\u00a0ashtanga yoga are paths to God-realization, without blending bhakti in them, they all become like dead bodies without life-airs.\u201d\u00a0Various other scriptures also announce the same:bhakty\u0101hamekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25 \u015bhraddhay\u0101tm\u0101 priya\u1e25 sat\u0101m\u00a0\u00a0(Bhagavatam 11.14.21)\u201cI am only attained by My devotees who worship Me with faith and love.\u201dmilahi\u1e45 na raghupati binu anur\u0101g\u0101, kie\u00f1 joga tapa gy\u0101na bir\u0101g\u0101\u00a0\u00a0(Ramayan)\u201cOne may practice\u00a0ashtanga yoga, engage in austerities, accumulate knowledge, and develop detachment.Yet, without devotion, one will never attain God.\u201d"

        "commentary": "Those relentless souls who strive for Yog or union with God are true yogis. They recognize themselves to be tiny fragments of God and His eternal beatitude. They also realize the temporary nature of the material world and the futility of a materialistic life. Therefore, instead of running behind sensual pleasures, they endeavour to enhance their love for God. Such souls are on the path of light.On the other hand are the ignorant souls,\u00a0who are under the influence of maya, the material energy. They recognize themselves as only the body and the material world around them as the source of their pleasure. They continue to live through the miseries of material existence, being disdainful toward God or His eternal opulence. Thus, such souls are on the path of darkness.In this verse, Shree Krishna urges Arjun to recognize the difference between these two paths and choose the path of light, thus become a yogi. It is not that many of us do not take the path of light, but after some time are back on the path of darkness.\u00a0For instance, someone wishes to go east and walks one mile toward the rising sun in the morning. He rests in the afternoon for a while. Then he starts walking again toward the sun, which is now in the west. He walks for two miles only to find in the evening that he is one mile farther in the west from where he had started.\u00a0 Similarly, treading on the path of light only for some time will not work; it needs to be a constant process, else one will slip back into darkness again. Therefore, in this verse, Shree Krishna adds the phrase, \u201cat all times.\u201d It is for us to recognize the importance of being a yogi at all times. And avoid the danger of sliding back into the path of darkness."

        "commentary": "In the last verse of this chapter, Shree Krishna declares that: those yogis who follow the path of light reap the fruits of their endeavours beyond any other processes can bestow. He says that even though one may undertake Vedic sacrifices, perform austerities, charity, or accumulate knowledge of the self, but without devotion to God, it is not the path of light. The Ramayan states:nema dharma \u0101ch\u0101ra tapa gy\u0101na jagya japa d\u0101na,bhe\u1e63haja puni ko\u1e6dinha nahi\u1e45 roga j\u0101hi\u1e45 harij\u0101na.\u201cYou may engage in good conduct, righteousness, austerities, sacrifices,\u00a0ashtanga yoga, chanting of mantras, and charity.\u00a0 But without devotion to God, the mind\u2019s disease of material consciousness will not cease.\u201dAll these good deeds can only reap material rewards, which are temporary. However, devotion to God leads to liberation from the bondage of the material world. Therefore, the yogis who have realized this truth detach their mind from the material world and attach it to God alone. Treading on this path of light, they eventually attain eternal happiness."

He is very competent but is definitely not God.\u201d\u00a0 When those under the spell of rajo gu\u1e47a see Him, they say, \u201cThere is nothing special in Him.\u00a0 He is very much like us.\u201d\u00a0 When those dominated by tamo gu\u1e47a see Him, they think, \u201cHe is egotistic and characterless, much worse than us.\u201d\u00a0 It is only the God-realized saints who can recognize Him as God, since they have received divine vision by His grace.\u00a0 And so, Shree Krishna says that the unaware materially conditioned souls do not know Him when He takes an avatar in the world."

        "commentary": "Having said that the great souls engage in His devotion, Shree Krishna now explains how they do bhakti.\u00a0 He says that devotees become attached to k\u012brtan as a means of practicing their devotion and enhancing it.\u00a0 The chanting of the glories of the Lord is called k\u012brtan, which is defined as:\u00a0 n\u0101ma-l\u012bl\u0101-gu\u1e47ad\u012bn\u0101m uchchair-bh\u0101\u1e63h\u0101 tu k\u012brtanam (Bhakti Ras\u0101m\u1e5bit Sindhu 1.2.145)\u00a0 \u201cSinging glories of the Names, Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God is called k\u012brtan.\u201d\u00a0K\u012brtan is one of the most powerful means of practicing devotion.\u00a0 It involves the three-fold devotion of \u015bhrava\u1e47a (hearing), k\u012brtan (chanting), and smara\u1e47a (remembering).\u00a0 The goal is to fix the mind upon God, but it becomes easier when done alongside with hearing and chanting.\u00a0 As stated in chapter six, the mind is as restless as the wind, and naturally wanders from thought to thought.\u00a0 Hearing and chanting engage the knowledge senses in the divine realm, which helps in repeatedly bringing back the mind from its wanderings.\u00a0K\u012brtan has many other benefits as well.\u00a0 Often when people practice devotion through japa (chanting of mantra or Name of God on rosary beads) or plain meditation, they find themselves overwhelmed by sleep.\u00a0 However, k\u012brtan is such an engaging process that it usually drives sleep away.\u00a0 Also, chanting blocks out distracting sounds from the environment.\u00a0 K\u012brtan can be practiced in groups which enables mass participation.\u00a0 In addition, the mind desires variety, which it gets through the medium of k\u012brtan in the form of the Names, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, etc. of God.\u00a0 And since k\u012brtan involves loud chanting, the divine vibrations of the Names of God make the entire environment auspicious and holy.\u00a0For all these reasons, k\u012brtan has been the most popular form of devotion amongst saints in Indian history.\u00a0 All the famous bhakti Saints\u2014Soordas, Tulsidas, Meerabai, Guru Nanak, Kabir, Tukaram, Ekanath, Narsi Mehta, Jayadev, Tyagaraja, and others\u2014were great poets.\u00a0 They composed numerous devotional songs, and through them, they engaged in chanting, hearing, and remembering.The Vedic scriptures particularly extol k\u012brtan as the simplest and most powerful process of devotion in the present age of Kali.\u00a0k\u1e5bite yad dhy\u0101yato vi\u1e63h\u1e47u\u1e41 tret\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 yajato makhai\u1e25dw\u0101pare parichary\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 kalau tad dhari-k\u012brtan\u0101t\u00a0\u00a0 (Bhagavatam 12.3.52)\u201cThe best process of devotion in the age of Satya was simple meditation upon God.\u00a0 In the age of Tret\u0101, it was the performance of sacrifices for the pleasure of God.\u00a0 In the age of Dw\u0101par, worship of the deities was the recommended process.\u00a0 In the present age of Kali, it is k\u012brtan alone.\u201davik\u0101r\u012b v\u0101 vik\u0101r\u012b v\u0101 sarva do\u1e63haika bh\u0101jana\u1e25parame\u1e63ha pada\u1e41 y\u0101ti r\u0101ma n\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtan\u0101t\u00a0\u00a0 (Adhy\u0101tma Ramayan)\u201cWhether you are full of desires or free from them, devoid of defects or full of them, if you engage in k\u012brtan of the names of Lord Ram, you will attain the highest destination.\u201d\u00a0sarva dharma bahirbh\u016bta\u1e25 sarva p\u0101paratasthath\u0101muchyate n\u0101tra sandeho vi\u1e63h\u1e47ornam\u0101nuk\u012brtan\u0101t\u00a0\u00a0 (Vai\u015bhamp\u0101yan Samhit\u0101)\u201cEven those who are deeply sinful and bereft of religiosity can be saved by the chanting of the names of Lord Vishnu; of this, there is no doubt.\u201dkalijuga kevala hari guna g\u0101h\u0101, g\u0101vata nara p\u0101vahi\u1e45 bhava th\u0101h\u0101\u00a0\u00a0 (Ramayan)\u201cIn this age of Kali, there is one means of salvation.\u00a0 By engaging in the chanting of the glories of God, one can cross over this material ocean.\u201d\u00a0However, one must remember that in the process of k\u012brtan, hearing and chanting are helpers.\u00a0 The essence is to remember God.\u00a0 If we leave it out, the k\u012brtan will not purify the mind.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna says here that His devotees do k\u012brtan, while constantly engaging the mind in thinking of Him.\u00a0 They practice this with great determination for the purification of the mind."

        "commentary": "Since the soul is a tiny part of God, its every relationship is with Him.\u00a0 However, in bodily consciousness, we look upon the relatives of the body as our father, mother, beloved, child, and friend.\u00a0 We become attached to them and repeatedly bring them to our mind, thereby getting further bound in the material illusion.\u00a0 But none of these worldly relatives can give us the perfect love that our soul yearns for.\u00a0 This is for two reasons.\u00a0 Firstly, these relationships are temporary, and separation is unavoidable when either they or we depart from the world.\u00a0 Secondly, even as long as they are alive, the attachment is based on selfishness and so it fluctuates in direct proportion to the extent by which self-interest is satisfied.\u00a0 Thus, the range and intensity of worldly love varies from moment to moment, throughout the day.\u00a0 \u201cMy wife is very nice\u2026.she is not so nice\u2026she is ok\u2026.she is terrible,\u201d this is the extent of fluctuation of love in the drama of the world.\u00a0 On the other hand, God is such a relative who has accompanied us lifetime after lifetime.\u00a0 From birth to birth, in every life-form that we went, God accompanied us and remained seated in our heart.\u00a0 He is thus our eternal relative.\u00a0 In addition, He has no self-interest from us; He is perfect and complete in Himself.\u00a0 He loves us selflessly, for He only desires our eternal welfare.\u00a0 Thus, God alone is our perfect relative, who is both eternal and selfless.To understand this concept from another perspective, consider the analogy of an ocean and the waves that emerge from it.\u00a0 Two neighboring waves in the ocean flow together for some time, and play mirthfully with each other, creating the impression that they have a very deep relationship between them.\u00a0 However, after travelling some distance, one subsides into the ocean, and shortly after, the other does the same.\u00a0 Did they have any relationship between themselves?\u00a0 No, they were both born from the ocean and their relationship was with the ocean itself.\u00a0 Similarly, God is like the ocean and we are like waves who have emanated from Him.\u00a0 We create attachments amongst our bodily relations, only to leave everyone upon death, and journey alone into another birth.\u00a0 The truth is that the souls are not related to each other, but to God, from whom they have all emanated.In this verse, Shree Krishna takes us above bodily consciousness and its concomitant attachment to worldly relatives.\u00a0 From the platform of the soul, God alone is all our relationships; He is our Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, Beloved, and Friend.\u00a0 This theme is reiterated in all the Vedic scriptures:divyo deva eko n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47o m\u0101t\u0101 pit\u0101 bhr\u0101t\u0101 suh\u1e5bit gati\u1e25\u00a0 niv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 suh\u1e5bit gatirn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a iti \u00a0(Sub\u0101l \u015ahruti, mantra 6)\u00a0\u201cLord Narayan alone is the Mother, Father, Beloved, and destination of the soul.\u201dmore sabai eka tumha sw\u0101m\u012b, d\u012bnabhandhu ura antaraj\u0101m\u012b.\u00a0\u00a0 (Ramayan)\u201cO Lord Ram, You alone are my Master, the Savior of the destitute, and the Knower of the heart.\u201d\u00a0 Knowing the magnitude of our eternal relationship with God, we must endeavor to attach our mind to Him alone.\u00a0 Then, the mind will be purified and we will be able to fulfill the condition of m\u0101meka\u1e41 \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja, or complete surrender, which is necessary for receiving God\u2019s grace.\u00a0 To achieve this single-mindedness, we must cut all the present attachments of the mind and replace them with attachment to God.\u00a0 Hence, the Ramayan states:saba kai mamat\u0101 t\u0101ga ba\u1e6dor\u012b, mama pada manahi b\u0101\u00f1dha bari \u1e0dor\u012b.\u201cCut all the strings of worldly attachment of your mind; make a rope of these strings, and tie it at the lotus feet of God.\u201d\u00a0 To help us tie our mind to Him, Shree Krishna here explains to Arjun that the soul\u2019s every relationship is with God alone."

They perform the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas.\u00a0 This science of karm k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d (Vedic rituals) is referred to as trai-vidy\u0101.People who are fascinated by the science of trai-vidy\u0101 worship the celestial gods, such as Indra, through the performance of yaj\u00f1as (fire sacrifices) and other rituals.\u00a0 They worship the Supreme Lord indirectly because they do not realize that it is He alone who sanctions the gifts that the celestial gods bestow.\u00a0 Ritualistic ceremonies are considered good deeds, but they are not counted as devotion.\u00a0 The performers of ritualistic ceremonies do not get released from the cycle of life and death.\u00a0 They go to the higher planes of existence within the material universe, such as abode of Indra, the king of heaven.\u00a0 There, they enjoy exquisite celestial delights that are thousands of times more pleasurable than the sensual pleasures available on the earth.\u00a0 In the following verse, Shree Krishna points out the defect in celestial pleasures."

Do what you like.\u00a0 God will settle our dispute.\u00a0 He is watching and will definitely punish you.\u00a0 You cannot escape.\u201d\u00a0 This sort of statement does not indicate that the person making it is a saint, possessing absolute faith in God, for even common persons believe that God is perfectly just.\u00a0However, the previous verse by Shree Krishna creates the doubt that God is partial toward His devotees, because while everyone is subject to the law of karma, God releases His devotees from it.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t this symptomatic of the defect of partiality?\u00a0 Shree Krishna feels it necessary to clarify this point and begins the verse by saying samo\u2019 ham, meaning, \u201cNo, no, I am equal to all.\u00a0 But I have a uniform law in accordance with which I bestow My grace.\u201d\u00a0 This law was previously stated in verse 4.11: \u201cIn whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.\u201dThe rainwater falls equally upon the earth.\u00a0 Yet, the drop that falls on the cornfields gets converted into grain; the drop that falls on the desert bush gets converted into a thorn; the drop that falls in the gutter becomes dirty water; and the drop that falls in the oyster becomes a pearl.\u00a0 There is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land.\u00a0 The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.\u00a0 Similarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.\u00a0 So, what can people do whose hearts are impure?\u00a0 Shree Krishna now reveals the purifying power of bhakti."

        "commentary": "How can devotees be considered venerable, merely for having made the correct resolve?\u00a0 Shree Krishna explains that if they continue the process of exclusive devotion with unflinching faith in God, their hearts will become purified and they will swiftly develop saintly virtues.\u00a0Divine virtues emanate from God Himself.\u00a0 He is perfectly just, truthful, compassionate, loving, merciful, etc.\u00a0 Since we souls are His tiny parts, we are all naturally drawn to these godly qualities.\u00a0 But the process of becoming virtuous remains an elusive mystery.\u00a0 From childhood, we have heard that we must speak the truth, serve others, be free from anger, etc. and yet we are unable to put those teachings into practice for the simple reason that our mind is impure.\u00a0 Without purification of the mind, blemishes of character cannot be eradicated fully and permanently.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj declares the irrefutable truth regarding developing divine virtues:satya ahins\u0101 \u0101di mana! bina hari bhajana na p\u0101yajala te gh\u1e5bita nikale nah\u012b\u00f1, ko\u1e6dina kariya up\u0101ya\u00a0\u00a0 (Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 35)\u201cOil stains on a cloth cannot be removed by water, no matter how much we try.\u00a0 Similarly, truthfulness, non-violence, and other virtuous qualities cannot be acquired without engaging in devotion to God.\u201d\u00a0 These qualities manifest when the mind is purified; and the purification of the mind cannot take place without attaching it to the all-pure God.\u00a0Further, Shree Krishna asks Arjun to boldly declare that His devotees will never perish.\u00a0 He does not say, \u201cThe j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b (person of knowledge) will not be lost.\u201d\u00a0 Nor does He say, \u201cThe karm\u012b (performer of rituals) shall not perish.\u201d\u00a0 He makes His promise for His bhaktas (devotees), saying that \u201cthey shall never come to ruin.\u201d\u00a0 Thereby, He reiterates what He had stated in verse 9.22, that He personally carries the burden of maintaining those who depend upon Him and engage in exclusive devotion unto Him.It may seem intriguing why Shree Krishna asks Arjun to make this statement, instead of declaring it Himself?\u00a0 The reason is that under special circumstances the Lord sometimes breaks His word, but He never permits His devotees\u2019 word to be broken.\u00a0 For example, Shree Krishna had resolved that He would not lift weapons during the Mahabharat war.\u00a0 But when Bheeshma, considered the perfect devotee, resolved that he would either kill Arjun by sunset the next day or make the Lord lift weapons to protect him, Shree Krishna broke His own vow to protect the vow made by Bheeshma.\u00a0 Thus, to reaffirm the strength of His statement, Shree Krishna here says, \u201cArjun, you declare that My devotee will never perish, for I shall guarantee that your word will be kept.\u201d"

        "commentary": "Here, Shree Krishna continues explaining how he is the source of everything that exists. Previously, he mentioned twenty emotions; now, he mentions twenty-five elevated personalities. These are the seven great Sages, the four great Saints, and the fourteen Manus. He also gives a genealogical synopsis of the universe that is born of him.Brahma was born from the Hira\u1e47yagarbh energy of Vishnu (the form of God that is responsible for administering the material creation). From Brahma were born the four great saints, who are Sanak, Sanandan, Sanat, Sanatan. They are also called the four Kumars. In our universe, the four Kumars are the eldest children of Brahma. Since theirs was an asexual birth from the mind of their father alone, they have no mother. Being eternally liberated souls and experts in the science of Yog, they were empowered to help others attain liberation through spiritual s\u0101dhan\u0101. After the four Kumars, came the seven sages. These are Mareech, Angira, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasishtha. They were empowered with the task of procreation of the human population. Then come the fourteen Manus, Svayambhuva, Swarochisha, Uttam, Tamas, Raivat, Chakshusha, Vaivasvat, Savarni, Dakshasavarni, Brahmasavarni, Dharmasavarni, Rudra-putra, Rochya, and Bhautyaka. They were empowered for the administration of humankind from the celestial abodes, and for the establishment and protection of Vedic dharma. We are presently in the era of the seventh Manu, who is called Vaivasvat Manu. This era is thus called Vaivasvat Manvantar. In the present kalp (day of Brahma), there will be seven more Manus.In the celestial abodes, there are many devat\u0101s who are discharging the function of maintaining the universe. All these personalities are sons and grandsons of Brahma, who in turn was born from Lord Vishnu, who in turn is a non-different expansion of Shree Krishna. Therefore, we can say that Shree Krishna is the original forefather of all forefathers (prapit\u0101maha)."

There is a direct relationship between knowledge and love, as the following example reveals. Let us say that your friend shows you a black pebble-like stone. You have no knowledge of its importance, and thus, you have no love for it either. Your friend says, \u201cThis is a \u015bh\u0101ligr\u0101m, and a saintly personality has gifted it to me.\u201d A \u015bh\u0101ligr\u0101m is a special kind of fossil stone worshipped as a representation of Lord Vishnu.

Let us say your friend further adds, \u201cDo you know it used to be worshipped five hundred years ago by the great saint, Swami Ramananda?\u201d The moment you hear this piece of knowledge, your respect for the stone will increase further. Each time, it is the knowledge that is boosting your reverence for the stone. Similarly, proper knowledge of God enhances devotion toward him. Thus, having described God\u2019s majestic splendors that manifest in the wondrous workings of unlimited universes, Shree Krishna states that those who become situated in this knowledge naturally become united with him through unflinching bhakti."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna begins the verse by saying aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo, meaning \u201cI am the Supreme Ultimate Truth and the cause of all causes.\u201d He has repeated this multiple times in the Bhagavad Gita, in verses 7.7, 7.12, 10.2-3, and 15.15. It is also strongly proclaimed in all the other scriptures. The Rig Veda states:ya\u1e41 k\u0101maye ta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 ugra\u1e41 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47omi ta\u1e41 brahm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 ta\u1e41 \u1e5bi\u1e63hi\u1e41 ta\u1e41 sumedhsam(10.125.5)[v4]\u201cI make the persons I love exceedingly mighty; I make them men or women; I make them wise sages; I make a soul empowered for the seat of Brahma.\u201d The wise who comprehend this truth develop firm faith and worship him with loving devotion.Thus, Shree Krishna is the Supreme Lord of both the material and spiritual creations. However, administering creation is not the primary work of God. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states:swaya\u1e41 bhagav\u0101nera karma nahe bh\u0101ra-hara\u1e47a(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela 4.8)[v5]\u201cShree Krishna does not directly involve himself in the works of creating, maintaining, and dissolving the material universes.\u201d Shree Krishna\u2019s primary activity is to engage in eternal loving pastimes with the liberated souls in Golok, his divine abode. For the purpose of material creation, he expands himself as Karanodakshayi Vishnu, who is also called Maha Vishnu.Maha Vishnu is thus the form of the Lord that presides over the material realm, consisting of infinite material universes. Maha Vishnu is also known as Pratham Puru\u1e63h (first expansion of God in the material realm). He resides in the divine water of the k\u0101ra\u1e47 (causal) ocean and manifests innumerable material universes from the pores of his body. He then expands himself to reside at the bottom of each universe as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, who is called Dwit\u012bya Puru\u1e63h (second expansion of God in the material realm).From Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Brahma is born. He guides the process of creation\u2014creating the various gross and subtle elements of the universe, the laws of nature, the galaxies and planetary systems, the forms of life residing in them, etc. Hence, Brahma is often referred to as the creator of the universe. However, he is actually the secondary creator.Garbhodakashayi Vishnu further expands himself as Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, and resides at the top of each universe, in a place called K\u1e63h\u012bra S\u0101gar. Kshirodakshayi Vishnu is also known as T\u1e5bit\u012bya Puru\u1e63h (third expansion of God in the material realm). He resides at the top of the universe, but he also resides as the Supreme soul, in the heart of all living beings in the universe, noting their karmas, keeping an account, and giving the results at the appropriate time. He is thus known as the maintainer of the universe.All the three forms of Lord Vishnu mentioned here are non-different from Shree Krishna. Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna states that all spiritual and material creation emanate from him. Shree Krishna is also called the Avat\u0101r\u012b (the source of all the Avat\u0101rs). The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gvatam states: ete ch\u0101\u1e41\u015bha kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam (1.3.28)[v6] \u201cAll the forms of God are the expansions, or the expansions of the expansions of Shree Krishna, who is the primordial form of God.\u201d And so, the secondary creator Brahma prays to Shree Krishna:yasyaikani\u015bhvasita k\u0101lamath\u0101valambyaj\u012bvanti lomavilaj\u0101 jagada\u1e47\u1e0dan\u0101th\u0101\u1e25vi\u1e63h\u1e47urmah\u0101n saihayasya kal\u0101vi\u015bhe\u1e63hogovindam\u0101di puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 tamaha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi(Brahma Samhit\u0101 5.48)[v7]\u201cInfinite universes\u2014each having Shankar, Brahma, and Vishnu\u2014manifest from the pores of Maha Vishnu\u2019s body when he breathes in, and again dissolve into him when he breathes out.

        "commentary": "The nature of the mind is to become absorbed in what it likes most. Devotees of the Lord become absorbed in remembering him because they develop deep adoration for him. His devotion becomes the basis of their life, from which they derive meaning, purpose, and the strength to live. They feel it as essential to remember God as a fish feels it essential to have water.What is most dear to people\u2019s hearts can be determined by where they dedicate their mind, body, and wealth. The Bible states: \u201cFor where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.\u201d (Matthew 6:21)[v8]. You can see where people\u2019s hearts are by studying their checkbooks and credit card statements. If they are spending money on fancy cars, that\u2019s where their heart is. If they are spending on luxurious holidays, that\u2019s what is most dear to them. If they are donating in charity to African children with AIDS, that is what absorbs their attention the most. The love of parents for their children is visible in the fact that they are willing to sacrifice their time and wealth in their welfare. Likewise, the love of the devotees manifests in their dedicating themselves to God. Shree Krishna says: mad-gata-pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e25, implying, \u201cMy devotees surrender their lives to me.\u201dFrom such surrender, comes contentment. Since devotees offer the results of their activities to their beloved Lord, they see every situation as coming from him. Hence, they gladly accept both positive and negative circumstances as the will of God, and remain equipoised in both.While the devotees\u2019 love for God is displayed in the form of the above characteristics, it also manifests on their lips. They find great relish in conversing about the glories of God, and his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, and devotees. In this way, by engaging in k\u012brtan (chanting) and shrava\u1e47a (hearing) regarding the glories of God, they relish his sweetness for themselves and share it with others as well. They contribute to one another\u2019s progress by enlightening others about divine knowledge of God (bodhayanti). Speaking and singing about the glories of God gives the devotees great satisfaction (tu\u1e63hyanti), and delight (ramanti). In this way, they worship him through the processes of remembering, hearing, and chanting. This is the threefold bhakti comprising of shrava\u1e47a, k\u012brtan, and smara\u1e47a. This has previously been described in the commentary on verse 9.14.Having described how his devotees worship him, Shree Krishna now explains how he responds to their devotional activities."

        "commentary": "Divine knowledge of God is not attained by the flight of our intellect. No matter how powerful a mental machine we may possess, we have to admit the fact that our intellect is made from the material energy. Hence, our thoughts, understanding, and wisdom are confined to the material realm; God and his divine realm remain entirely beyond the scope of our corporeal intellect. The Vedas emphatically declare:yasy\u0101 mata\u1e41 tasya mata\u1e41 mata\u1e41 yasya na veda sa\u1e25avij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 vij\u0101nat\u0101\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101tamavij\u0101nat\u0101m(Kenopani\u1e63had 2.3)[v9]\u201cThose who think they can understand God with their intellects have no understanding of God. Only those who think that he is beyond the scope of their comprehension truly understand him.\u201dThe B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had states:sa e\u1e63ha neti nety\u0101tm\u0101 g\u1e5bihyo\u1e25\u00a0(3.9.26)[v10]\u201cOne can never comprehend God by self-effort based upon the intellect.\u201d The Ramayan states:r\u0101ma atarkya buddhi mana b\u0101n\u012b, mata ham\u0101ra asa sunahi say\u0101n\u012b [v11]\u201cLord Ram is beyond the scope of our intellect, mind, and words.\u201d Now, if these statements on the topic of knowing God plainly declare that it is not possible to know him, how then can God-realization be possible for anyone? Shree Krishna reveals here how knowledge of God can be gained. He says that it is God who bestows divine knowledge upon the soul, and the fortunate soul who receives his grace is able to know him. The Yajur Veda states:tasya no r\u0101sva tasya no dheh\u012b [v12]\u201cWithout bathing oneself in the nectar emanating from the lotus feet of God, no one can know him.\u201d Thus, true knowledge of God is not a result of intellectual gymnastics but a consequence of divine grace. Shree Krishna also mentions in this verse that he does not choose the recipient of his grace in a whimsical manner. Rather, he bestows it upon those who unite their minds with him in devotion. He next talks about what happens when we receive divine grace."

        "commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna further elaborates the concept of grace. Previously, he had explained that he bestows it upon those who lovingly absorb their minds in him and make him the paramount object of their plans, thoughts, and activities. Now, he reveals what happens when someone receives his grace. He says that he destroys the darkness in their heart with the lamp of wisdom.\nIgnorance is often symbolized as darkness, but what is this lamp of wisdom that God talks about? At present, our senses, mind, and intellect are all material, while God is divine. Hence, we are unable to see him, hear him, know him, or be united with him. When God bestows his grace, he confers his divine Yogmaya energy upon the soul. It is also called \u015bhuddha sattva (divine mode of goodness), which is distinct from the sattva gu\u1e47a (mode of goodness) of Maya. When we receive that \u015bhuddha sattva energy, our sense, mind, and intellect become divine. To put it simply, by his grace, God bestows his divine senses, divine mind, and divine intellect to the soul. Equipped with these divine instruments, the soul is able to see God, hear God, know God, and be united with God. Hence, the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan states: vi\u015bhe\u1e63h\u0101nugraha\u015bh cha (3.4.38)[v13] \u201cOnly by God\u2019s grace does one gain divine knowledge.\u201d In this way, the torchlight that Shree Krishna refers to is his divine power. By the light of God\u2019s divine power the darkness of the material energy is dispelled."

Thus, Arjun quotes the saints, such as Narad, Asit, Deval, and Vyas, who have proclaimed Shree Krishna as the Supreme Divine Personality and the cause of all causes. In the Bheeshma Parva of the Mahabharat, there is a poem in which many sages eulogize Shree Krishna.

He asserts that all Shree Krishna has stated is factual and not any metaphorical description. He addresses Shree Krishna as Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Lord. The word Bhagav\u0101n is defined in Dev\u012b Bh\u0101gavat Pur\u0101\u1e47 in the following manner:ai\u015bhwaryasya samagrasya dharmasya ya\u015bhasa\u1e25 \u015bhriya\u1e25j\u00f1\u0101navair\u0101gyo\u015bhchaiva \u1e63a\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 bhagav\u0101nni\u1e25 [v14]\u201cBhagav\u0101n is he who possesses these six opulences to the infinite extent\u2014strength, knowledge, beauty, fame, opulence, and renunciation.\u201d The devat\u0101s (celestial gods), d\u0101navas (demons), m\u0101navas (human beings) all have finite abilities to understand.

However, apart from the daityas, Diti desired to have a son more powerful than Indra (the king of the celestial gods). So she kept her baby in her womb for a year. Indra then used a thunderbolt and split her fetus into many pieces, but it turned into many fetuses. These became the maruts, or the 49 kinds of winds that flow in the universe, doing tremendous good. The major ones amongst them are Avaha, Pravaha, Nivaha, Purvaha, Udvaha, Samvaha, and Parivaha. The chief wind, known as Parivaha, also bears the name Marichi. Shree Krishna states that his vibh\u016bti (opulence) manifests in the wind called \u201cMarichi.\u201d"

Amongst these, the Sama Veda describes God\u2019s glories as they manifest in the celestial gods, who are in charge of administering the universe. The S\u0101ma Veda is also the most musical and is sung in praise of the Lord. It is enchanting to those who understand it and it evokes devotion amongst its listeners.Vasava is another name for Indra, the chief of the celestial gods. He is unparalleled among souls in fame, power, and rank. Only a soul with many lifetimes of pious deeds is promoted to the position of Indra. Thus, Indra reflects the resplendent glories of God.The five senses function correctly only if the mind is attentive to them. If the mind wanders away, the senses cannot function properly. For example, you hear with your ears what people say, but if your mind wanders away while they are speaking, their words are lost to you. So the mind is the king of the senses. Shree Krishna speaks of it as reflecting his power, and later in the Bhagavad Gita, he mentions it as the sixth and most important sense (verse 15.7).Consciousness is the quality of the soul that distinguishes it from insentient matter. The difference between a living person and a dead person is the presence of consciousness in the living person\u2019s body and its absence in a dead person\u2019s body. Consciousness exists in the soul by the divine power of God. Hence, the Vedas state: chetana\u015bhchetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had 2.2.13)[v27] \u201cGod is the sentience in the sentient.\u201d"

Amongst these, agni (fire) gives warmth and energy to the rest of the elements. Thus, Shree Krishna mentions it as his special manifestation.Meru is a mountain in the celestial abodes famed for its rich natural resources. It is believed to be the axis around which many heavenly bodies rotate. Shree Krishna thus speaks of it as his glory. As wealth distinguishes a wealthy person, these glories reveal the vibh\u016btis of God."

He is thus the topmost of all priests. Here, Shree Krishna says that amongst priests, he is Brihaspati. However, in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, verse 11.16.22, Shree Krishna states that amongst the priests he is Vashishtha. Why is he differing in the two places? This implies that we should not attach importance to the object, but to the opulence of God that manifests in that object. All the objects of glory that Shree Krishna is describing here should also be understood in the same light. It is not the object that is being emphasized, rather God\u2019s opulence that is manifesting in it.Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiv, who is also called Skanda, is the commander-in-chief of the celestial gods. He is thus the chief of all military commanders, and best reflects the opulence of God. Shree Krishna further says that amongst stagnant bodies of water, he is the grave and mighty ocean."

Shree Krishna had declared previously, in verses 7.8 and 8.13, the syllable \u201cOm\u201d to be a sacred sound. It is the an\u0101hat n\u0101d (the sound vibration that pervades creation).

Indra, the king of heaven was once driven out of his celestial kingdom by a demon named Vritrasura. The demon had a boon whereby he could not be killed by any weapon known till then. In desperation, Indra approached Lord Shiv for help, who took him to Lord Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to Indra that the only weapon that could kill Vritrasura was a thunderbolt made from the bones of the sage Dadhichi. Indra then beseeched Dadhichi to make the ultimate sacrifice of laying down his life so that his bones could be used for making the thunderbolt. Dadhichi accepted the request, but desired to first go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers. Indra then brought together all the waters of the holy rivers to Naimisharanya, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without further loss of time. Dadhichi then gave up his body by the practice of yogic techniques. The thunderbolt made from his bones was then used to defeat the demon Vritrasura, allowing Indra to regain his place as the king of the celestial abodes. Shree Krishna deliberately refers to this thunderbolt here as the representation of the glory of God, preferring it above the mace and disc that are always held in the hands of Lord Vishnu.In this verse, Shree Krishna also reveals that the act of sexual intercourse is not unholy when it is performed for the sole purpose of begetting good children. Kaamdev, the god of love (cupid), is responsible for the force of attraction between the opposite sexes that facilitates the continuance of humankind through procreation. This sexual urge has its origin in God, and should not be mis-utilized for sensual enjoyment, but rather be used solely for the purpose of begetting worthy progeny. In verse 7.11 as well, Shree Krishna had declared that he is the sexual desire that is not in conflict with virtue and scriptural injunctions."

Additionally, the science of spirituality liberates human beings from material bondage and gives them immortality. Thus, it is superior to the previously mentioned vidy\u0101s. This is mentioned in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam as well: s\u0101 vidy\u0101 tanmatiryay\u0101 (Verse 4.29.49)[v30] \u201cThe best knowledge is that by which the intellect becomes attached to the lotus feet of God.\u201dIn the field of argument and logic, jalpa means to find fault with the opponent\u2019s statements, for the sake of establishing one\u2019s own opinion. Vita\u1e47\u1e0da means to avoid proper deliberation on the truth through evasion and frivolous arguments. V\u0101da is the logical conclusion of the discussion.

Hence, the letter \u201ca\u201d is the most important in the Sanskrit alphabet. \u201cA\u201d is also the first vowel of the alphabet, and since the vowels are written before the consonants, \u201cA\u201d comes at the very beginning.\nAlthough Sanskrit is such an ancient language, it is highly refined and sophisticated. A common procedure in Sanskrit language is to combine words to form compound words. When, in the process of making one compound word, two or more words give up their case endings, it is called sam\u0101sa, and the resulting word is called sam\u0101sa pada, or compound word. There are primarily six kinds of sam\u0101sa: 1) dwandva, 2) bahub\u1e5bihi, 3) karm dh\u0101ray, 4) tatpuru\u1e63h, 5) dwigu, 6) avyay\u012b bh\u0101v. Amongst these, dwandva is the best because both words remain prominent in it, while in the others, either one word becomes more prominent, or both words combine together to give the meaning of a third word. The dual word Radha-Krishna is an example of dwandva. Shree Krishna highlights it as his vibh\u016bti.\nCreation is a magnificent act and awesome to behold. Humankind\u2019s most sophisticated and technologically advanced inventions pale in comparison. Therefore, Lord Krishna singles out the first-born Brahma, who made the entire universe, and says that amongst creators, the creative ability of Brahma best reflects the glory of God."

It was Yudhishthir\u2019s weakness for gambling that led to the Mahabharat war. But if gambling is also God\u2019s glory, then is there no harm in it, and why is it forbidden?The answer is that God grants his power to the soul, and along with it, he gives the freedom of choice. If we choose to forget him, he gives us the power to forget. This is just as electric power can be used both to heat and cool a house. The user is free to choose how to utilize the power. However, the powerhouse that supplies the energy is not responsible for either the use or misuse of the power. Similarly, a gambler too possesses intellect and ability that is supplied by God. But if he decides to misuse these God-given gifts, then God is not responsible for the sinful deeds.Everyone likes victory; it reveals the glory of the Lord.

Punishment, when meted out in a timely and just manner, is an important tool for reforming sinful behavior in people and training them in right conduct.

Modern management theory describes very nicely how even one minute of proper punishment for wrong actions and one minute of suitable reward for good actions can rectify people\u2019s behaviors.\nThe desire for victory is universal, but those with the strength of character are not willing to sacrifice morals or ethics to achieve it.

A paint company in India would advertise, \u201cWhenever you see colors think of us.\u201d In this case, Shree Krishna\u2019s statement is tantamount to saying, \u201cWherever you see a manifestation of glory, think of me.\u201d"

Similarly, whenever we observe extraordinary splendor anywhere, whatever catches our imagination, sends us in raptures, and infuses us with bliss, we should know it to be but a spark of the glory of God. He is the infinite reservoir of beauty, glory, power, knowledge, and opulence. He is the powerhouse from where all beings and things get their splendor. Thus, we must make God, who is the source of all glory, the object of our worship."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna\u2019s statement indicates that he has already answered the question. Now, of his own accord, he wants to tell something remarkable. Having revealed many amazing aspects of his splendor, he says that the magnitude of his glory cannot be judged even from the sum total of what he has described, for the entire creation of unlimited universes is held within a fraction of his being.Why does he make a reference to a fraction of his being here? The reason is that the entire material creation consisting of unlimited universes is only one-fourth of God\u2019s entire manifestation; the remaining three-fourths is the spiritual creation.p\u0101do \u2019sya vi\u015bhw\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni trip\u0101dasy\u0101m\u1e5bita\u1e41 divi (Puru\u1e63h S\u016bktam Mantra 3)[v32]\u201cThis temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of the Supreme Divine Personality. The other three parts are his eternal abodes that are beyond the phenomenon of life and death.\u201dInterestingly, Shree Krishna is in front of Arjun, within the world, yet he reveals that the entire world is within a fraction of his being. This is like the story of Ganesh and Lord Shiv. Once, Sage Narad gave Lord Shiv a very special fruit. Lord Shiv\u2019s two children, Kartikeya and Ganesh both began demanding the fruit from him. Lord Shiv thought that if he would give it to any one of them, the other would think that their father was biased. So Lord Shiv announced a competition for his two children. Whoever circumambulated the entire universe and came back to him first would get the fruit.On hearing this, Kartikeya immediately started off to circumambulate the universe. He was athletically and powerfully built and decided to take advantage of it. In comparison, Ganesh had a plump body and felt he was handicapped in competing with his brother. So, Ganesh decided to make up for it by using his intellect. Lord Shiv and Parvati were standing there. Ganesh circumambulated them thrice, and then announced, \u201cFather, I have done it. Please give me the fruit.\u201d Lord Shiv, \u201cBut how have you gone around the universe? You have been with us all the while.\u201d Ganesh said, \u201cFather, you are God. The entire universe exists within you. If I have gone around you, I have gone around the entire universe.\u201d Lord Shiv had to agree that his son Ganesh was very smart, and indeed he had won the competition.Just as Lord Shiv was standing in one place, and yet the entire world was contained in him, similarly, Shree Krishna announces to Arjun that the entire creation, consisting of unlimited material universes, is held within a fraction of his being."

Often scholars, basing their opinion upon dry intellectual analysis, have difficulty in accepting the concept of God as a person. They wish to perceive God as only an impersonal light, without attributes, virtues, qualities, and pastimes. However, when we tiny souls possess a personality, then why should we deny a personality to the Supreme Lord? Not only can he have a personality, but he also has the best personality, and therefore he is the Supreme Divine Personality. The difference between our personality and God\u2019s personality is that he is not only a perfect person; he also has his impersonal all-pervading aspect, which is devoid of attributes and form.Arjun declares that he accepts the reality of Shree Krishna\u2019s divine personality, precisely as has been described to him. He has complete faith in his personal form, and yet, he desires to see Shree Krishna\u2019s vi\u015bhwar\u016bp, or universal form, replete with all opulences.

        "commentary": "When the Supreme Lord descends in the world, he has two kinds of forms\u2014one is the material form that can be seen with material eyes, and the other is his divine form that can only be seen with divine vision. Thus, human beings do see him during his descension upon the earth, but they see only his material form. His divine form is not visible to their material eyes. That is the reason why souls in this material world cannot recognize God when he takes an Avat\u0101r on earth. Shree Krishna mentioned this in the ninth chapter, verse 11: \u201cWhen I descend in My personal form deluded persons are unable to recognize Me. They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.\u201d What people see is only the material form of the divine descension.The same theory applies to his cosmic form. In the previous two verses, Shree Krishna asked Arjun to see the cosmic form, but Arjun could see nothing because he had material eyes. The physical eyes are insufficient to see that universal form and the ordinary intellect is unequipped to comprehend it. Thus, Shree Krishna now says that he will grant the divine vision with which it will become possible to behold the universal form with all its majesty.The granting of spiritual vision is an act of grace by the Supreme Lord. By his grace, God adds his divine eyes to the soul\u2019s material eyes; he adds his divine mind to the soul\u2019s material mind; he adds his divine intellect to the soul\u2019s material intellect. Then, equipped with the divine senses, mind, and intellect of God, the soul can see his divine form, think of it, and comprehend it."

Thinking of Shree Krishna as her son, Yashoda chastised him severely one day, for eating mud despite her constant admonitions, and asked him to open his mouth so that she may see what was in it. However, to her immense wonder, when Shree Krishna opened his mouth, he revealed within it a vision of his cosmic form by his Yogmaya power. Yashoda was bewildered to see such unlimited wonders in the mouth of her little child. She was so overcome by the spectacle that she came on the verge of swooning, when Shree Krishna touched her and brought her back to normalcy.\nThe same cosmic form that the Lord revealed to his mother, Yashoda, he is now revealing to his friend, Arjun.

Earlier, he had looked upon him as an intimate friend and interacted in a manner befitting a close associate. He was aware in the back of his head that Shree Krishna was God, but the love overflowing in his heart would make him forget the almighty aspect of Shree Krishna\u2019s personality. All he would remember was that he loved his friend Shree Krishna more than anything in the world.That is the nature of love. It absorbs the mind so deeply that the devotee forgets the formal position of his Beloved Lord. And if formality is retained, then love is unable to manifest in its fullness. For example, a wife loves her husband deeply. Though he may be the governor of the state, the wife only looks upon him as her husband, and that is how she is able to interact intimately with him. If she keeps this knowledge in her head that her husband is the governor, then each time he comes by, she will be inclined to stand on her feet and pay a more ceremonial respect for him. So, the knowledge of the official position of the beloved gets immersed in the loving sentiments. The same phenomenon takes place in devotion to God.The cowherds of Braj merely viewed Shree Krishna as their bosom buddy. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj describes their pastimes with Shree Krishna very sweetly:dekho dekho r\u012b, gw\u0101la b\u0101lana y\u0101r\u012b rijhavata khela jit\u0101ya sakhana ko, gho\u1e5b\u0101 bani bani banaw\u0101r\u012b(Prem Ras Madir\u0101, Rasiy\u0101 M\u0101dhuri, Pada 7)[v7]\u201cLook at the sweetness of the loving interactions between Shree Krishna and his cowherd friends! They play games together, and when Shree Krishna loses the game, he becomes a horse by sitting on all fours and his friend rides on his back.\u201d If the cowherd friends remembered that Shree Krishna was God, they would never have the gumption to do such a thing. And the Lord too relishes the intimacy of such interactions with his devotees in which they relate with him as a dear friend.Shree Krishna enacted the famous Goverdhan leela pastime upon the earth, in which he lifted the Goverdhan Hill on the little finger of his left hand, to protect the residents of the land of Braj from the rain caused by Indra, the king of heaven and the celestial god of rain. However, Krishna\u2019s little cowherd associates were not impressed. In their eyes, Krishna was merely a loveable friend, and so they did not believe he could lift the hill. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states in continuation to the verse above:nakha dh\u0101ryo goverdhana-giri jaba, sakhana kahyo hama giridh\u0101r\u012b (Prem Ras Madir\u0101, Rasiy\u0101 M\u0101dhur\u012b, Pada 7)[v8]\u201cWhen Shree Krishna lifted the Goverdhan Hill, his cowherd friends applied their sticks to the bottom of the hill, thinking that they were the actual lifters of the hill.\u201d At the end, Indra accepted defeat and came seated on his white elephant. He apologized for having sent the torrential rain, without realizing Shree Krishna\u2019s supreme position.Now, when the cowherd boys saw Indra, the King of heaven, coming and offering obeisance to their friend Krishna, they realized that Krishna is God. So, they began looking at him fearfully from a distance. Seeing their devotional sentiment change from friendship to awe and reverence, Shree Krishna lamented, \u201cThat loving exchange we were enjoying has vanished. They are now thinking I am God.\u201d So by his Yogmaya power, he made them forget the significance of what they had seen, and they again felt that Shree Krishna was nothing more than their friend.Arjun was also a devotee of Shree Krishna in sakhya bh\u0101v. He was used to relating to Shree Krishna as his friend. That is why he had agreed to having Shree Krishna as his chariot driver. If his devotion had been motivated by the fact that Shree Krishna was the Supreme Lord of all creation, Arjun would never have allowed him to do such a demeaning service. But now, seeing his infinite splendor and inconceivable opulences, his fraternal sentiment toward Shree Krishna was replaced by fear."

And yet, the vision of it has dried up the camaraderie that Arjun was previously experiencing toward Shree Krishna, and he is overcome with fear. Seeing the many wondrous and amazingly frightful manifestations of the Lord, Arjun is now scared, and thinks that Shree Krishna is angry with him. So he asks for mercy."

He too had heroic qualities. When Shree Krishna disclosed to him he was the eldest son of Kunti and the Pandavas were actually his brothers, he asked Shree Krishna not to disclose this secret to Yudhisthir, or else he would stop trying to kill Karn and would lose the war. Since Karn had taken the side of Duryodhan in the war, he too was destined to die."

It will determine when the great personalities like Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and Karn will meet their end.

He has already decided the annihilation of the unrighteous and the victory of the righteous as the outcome of the battle. His grand scheme for the welfare of the world cannot be averted by any means. He now informs Arjun that he wishes him to be the nimitta-m\u0101tram, or the instrument of his work. God does not need the help of a human for his work, but humans attain eternal welfare by working to fulfill God\u2019s wish. Opportunities that come our way to accomplish something for the pleasure of the Lord are a very special blessing. It is by taking these opportunities that we attract his special grace, and achieve our permanent position as the servant of God.Shree Krishna also encourages Arjun to be his instrument by reminding him of the exceptional skills he has received in the art of archery by his grace. Hence, he addresses him with the vocative savya-s\u0101chin, meaning expert archer, since Arjun is admirably ambidextrous and is able to discharge arrows with either hand."

        "commentary": "Many of the generals on the side of the Kauravas were heretofore undefeated in combat. Jayadrath had the boon that whoever caused his head to fall on the ground would instantly have his own head burst into pieces. Karn had a special weapon called \u201c\u015ahakti\u201d given to him by Indra, which would slay anyone against whom it was used. But it could only be used once, and so Karn had kept it to take vengeance on Arjun. Dronacharya had received the knowledge of all weapons and how to neutralize them from Parshuram, who was an Avat\u0101r of God. Bheeshma had a boon that he would only die when he chose to do so. And yet, if God wished them to die in the battle, then nothing could save them. There is a saying:vindhya na \u012bndhana p\u0101iye, s\u0101gara ju\u1e0dai na n\u012braparai upas kuber ghara, jyo\u1e45 vipak\u1e63ha raghub\u012bra [v11]\u201cIf Lord Ram decides to be against you, then you may live in the Vindhyachal forest, but you will not be able to get firewood to light a fire; you may be by the side of the ocean, but water will be scarce for your usage; and you may live in the house of Kuber, the god of wealth, but you will not have enough to eat.\u201d Thus, even the biggest arrangements for security cannot avert a person\u2019s death if God has willed it to happen. Similarly, Shree Krishna says that he has already decided the outcome, but he wishes Arjun to be the medium to accomplish it and receive the glory of the conquest as a reward for his agency. Just as devotees wish to glorify God, it is God\u2019s nature to glorify his devotees. Hence, Shree Krishna does not wish the credit to come to him; he wishes people to say after the war, \u201cArjun fought so valiantly that he secured victory for the Pandavas.\u201dIn spiritual life too, aspirants often become discouraged when they find themselves incapable of removing the defects of anger, greed, envy, lust, pride, etc. Their Guru then encourages them, \u201cDo not be dejected. Fight and you will conquer the enemies of your mind because God wants you to succeed. Your effort will be instrumental, while God will fashion your victory by his grace.\u201dWhat was Arjun\u2019s reaction upon hearing the Lord\u2019s call to action? This is stated in the next verse."

He is everything that is manifest in creation because it is all his energy. He is also everything that remains unmanifest because it is his latent energy. And yet he is beyond both the manifest and the unmanifest because he is the Supreme Energetic\u2014the source and Supreme Master of all the energies. Hence, neither the material energy nor the souls can ever do anything to impact his personality, which is transcendental to both.Arjun specifically mentions that Shree Krishna is greater than the secondary creator Brahma because Brahma is the senior most in the universe. All living beings are either Brahma\u2019s progeny, or the descendants of his progeny. However, Brahma himself was born from a lotus that grew from the navel of Lord Vishnu, who is an expansion of Shree Krishna. Thus, while Brahma is considered as the senior most grandsire of the world, Shree Krishna is Brahma\u2019s Grandsire. It is thus apt that Brahma should bow to him."

He is worried that due to excessive familiarity, he had put himself on equal status with God and had presumptuously addressed him with affectionate vocatives, such as \u201cMy friend,\u201d \u201cMy dear buddy,\u201d and \u201cO Krishna.\u201d So he implores forgiveness for whatever he may have done in forgetfulness of the divinity of Shree Krishna\u2019s personality."

Shree Krishna is the father of the father\u2026 of all the fathers that exist. Similarly, he is the spiritual master of the spiritual master\u2026 of all the spiritual masters that are present. The first spiritual master was the creator Brahma, who passed on the knowledge to his disciple, and so on. However, Brahma received the Vedic knowledge from Shree Krishna. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam (1.1.1) states: tene brahma h\u1e5bid\u0101ya \u0101di kavaye [v20] \u201cShree Krishna imparted Vedic knowledge into the heart of the first-born Brahma.\u201d Thus, he is the supreme spiritual master.The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had states:na tatsama\u015bhch\u0101bhyadhika\u015bh cha d\u1e5bi\u015bhyate (6.8)[v21]\u201cNobody is equal to God, nor is anyone superior to him.\u201d Realizing Shree Krishna to be that same Supreme Lord of the Vedas, Arjun is declaring the above attributes regarding him."

        "commentary": "Considering his behavior as transgressions toward God, Arjun is asking for pardon. While interacting with Shree Krishna\u2014playing, eating, jesting, talking, and resting\u2014he did not show the respect that is appropriate toward the Supreme Almighty. However, no one minds transgressions when they are made because of a high level of intimacy shared with the other person. No government officer has the privilege to joke with the President of a country. Yet, the President\u2019s personal friend, teases him, jests with him, and even scolds him. The President does not mind, rather he values that jest of an intimate friend more than all the respect he receives from his subordinate officers. Thousands of people salute an army general, but they are not as dear to his heart as his wife, who sits intimately by his side. Similarly, Arjun\u2019s intimate dealings with Shree Krishna were not transgressions; they were gestures of the depth of his loving devotion in the sentiment of being a friend. Yet, a devotee is by nature humble, and so, out of humility, he feels that he may have committed transgressions, and hence he is asking for forgiveness."

        "commentary": "There are two kinds of bhakti\u2014ai\u015bhwarya bhakti and m\u0101dhurya bhakti. Ai\u015bhwarya bhakti is that where the devotee is motivated to engage in devotion by contemplating upon the almighty aspect of God. The dominant sentiment in ai\u015bhwarya bhakti is of awe and reverence. In such devotion, the feeling of remoteness from God and the need for maintaining propriety of conduct is always perceived. Examples of ai\u015bhwarya bhakti are the residents of Dwaraka and the residents of Ayodhya, who worshipped Shree Krishna and Lord Ram respectively as their kings. Ordinary citizens are highly respectful and obedient toward their king, although they never feel intimate with him.M\u0101dhurya bhakti is that where the devotee feels an intimate personal relationship with God. The dominant sentiment in such devotion is \u201cShree Krishna is mine and I am his.\u201d Examples of m\u0101dhurya bhakti are the cowherd boys of Vrindavan who loved Krishna as their friend, Yashoda and Nand baba, who loved Krishna as their child, and the gop\u012bs who loved him as their beloved. M\u0101dhurya bhakti is infinitely sweeter than ai\u015bhwarya bhakti. Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:sabai sarasa rasa dw\u0101rik\u0101, mathur\u0101 aru braja m\u0101hi\u00f1madhura, madhuratara, madhuratama, rasa brajarasa sama n\u0101hi\u00f1 (Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 70)[v22]\u201cThe divine bliss of God is immensely sweet in all his forms. Yet, there is a gradation in it\u2014the bliss of his Dwaraka pastimes is sweet, the bliss of his Mathura pastimes is sweeter, and the bliss of his Braj pastimes is the sweetest.\u201dIn M\u0101dhurya bhakti, forgetting the almightiness of God, devotees establish four kinds of relationships with Shree Krishna:D\u0101sya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Master and I am his servant. The devotion of Shree Krishna\u2019s personal servants, such as Raktak, Patrak, etc. was in d\u0101sya bh\u0101v. The sentiment that God is our Father or Mother is a variation of d\u0101sya bh\u0101v and is included in it.Sakhya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Friend and I am his intimate companion. The devotion of the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, such as Shreedama, Madhumangal, Dhansukh, Mansukh, etc. was in sakhya bh\u0101v.V\u0101tsalya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Child and I am his parent. The devotion of Yashoda and Nand baba was in v\u0101tsalya bh\u0101v.M\u0101dhurya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Beloved and I am his lover. The devotion of the gop\u012bs of Vrindavan was in m\u0101dhurya bh\u0101v.Arjun is a sakhya bh\u0101v devotee and relishes a fraternal relationship with the Lord. On seeing the universal form of God, Arjun experienced tremendous awe and reverence, and yet he longed for the sweetness of sakhya bh\u0101v that he was used to savoring. Hence, he prays to Shree Krishna to hide the almighty form that he is now seeing and again show his human form."

His divine personality encompasses unlimited universes. Yet, he is not attracted by the infinite opulences and is not interested in doing ai\u015bhwarya bhakti of God Almighty. Rather, he prefers seeing that Almighty Lord in the human form, so that he can relate to him as before, like a friend. Addressing Lord Krishna as sahasra-b\u0101ho, meaning \u201cthousand-armed one,\u201d Arjuna is now specifically requesting to see the chatur-bhuj r\u016bp, or four- armed form of Lord Krishna.In the four-armed form, Shree Krishna appeared before Arjun on another occasion as well.

He had bestowed a vision of his universal form by his grace, not as a form of punishment, but because he was very pleased with Arjun. He uses hyperbole as a figure of speech to stress how rare it is to see the universal form, by saying that Arjun is the first one to see it. Although Duryodhan and Yashoda were also given a glimpse of the universal form, it was not to this intensity, depth, and magnitude.Shree Krishna bestowed this divine vision upon Arjun with the help of his Yogmaya energy. This is the divine all-powerful energy of God. He has referred to it in many places, such as verses 4.6\u00a0and 7.25. It is by virtue of this Yogmaya energy that God is kartumakartum anyath\u0101 karatum samartha\u1e25 \u201cHe can do the possible, the impossible, and the contradictory at the same time.\u201d This divine power of God also manifests in the personal form and is worshipped in the Hindu tradition as the Divine Mother of the universe, in the form of Radha, Durga, Lakshmi, Kali, Sita, Parvati, etc."

This is only possible by his divine grace. This has been repeatedly stated in the Vedas as well:\ntasya no hr\u0101sva tasya no dhehi (Yajur Veda)[v24]\n\u201cWithout being anointed in the nectar of the grace of the Supreme Lord, nobody can see him.\u201d\nThe logic behind this is very straightforward. Our physical eyes are made from matter, and hence all that we can see is also material. The Supreme Lord is non-material\u2014he is divine. To have a vision of his divine form we need divine eyes. When God bestows his grace upon the soul, he adds his divine power to our material eyes, and only then can we see him.\nOne may ask that how was Sanjay also able to see that cosmic form, which Arjun saw by divine grace. The Mahabharat states that Sanjay also received by the grace of his Guru, Ved Vyas, who was an Avat\u0101r of God. Before the war, the Ved Vyas offered his student Sanjay divine vision so that he may be able to communicate the details of the war to Dhritarashtra. Hence, he saw the same cosmic form that Arjun saw. But later, when Duryodhan died, Sanjay was overwhelmed with grief and lost his divine vision."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna hid the vision of his cosmic form, and manifested before Arjun in his four-armed form, which is adorned with a golden diadem, disc, mace, and lotus flower. It is the repository of all divine opulences such as majesty, omniscience, omnipotence, etc. The four-armed form of Shree Krishna evokes the sentiment of awe and reverence, much like the sentiments of the citizens of a kingdom toward their king. However, Arjun was a sakh\u0101 (friend) of Shree Krishna, and devotion dominated by the sentiment of awe and reverence would never satisfy him. He had played with Shree Krishna, eaten with him, confided his private secrets to him, and shared loving personal moments with him. Such blissful devotion of sakhya bh\u0101v (devotion where God is seen as a personal friend) is infinitely sweeter than ai\u015bhwarya bhakti (devotion where God is revered as the distant and almighty Lord). Hence, to conform to Arjun\u2019s sentiment of devotion, Shree Krishna finally hid even his four-armed form, and transformed into his original two-armed form.Once in the forest of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna was engaging in loving pastimes with the gop\u012bs, when he suddenly disappeared from their midst. The gop\u012bs prayed for him to come back. Hearing their supplications, he manifested again, but in his four-armed form. The gop\u012bs thought him to be the Supreme Lord Vishnu, and accordingly they paid their obeisance. But they moved on, not being attracted to spend any further time with him. They had been habituated to seeing the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna as their soul-beloved, and this form of his as Lord Vishnu held no attraction for them. However, Radharani came onto the scene, and upon seeing her, Shree Krishna became overwhelmed in love for her, and could no longer maintain his four-armed form. His two arms automatically disappeared and he resumed his two-armed form. In this verse too, Shree Krishna returned to his most attractive two-armed form."

To enhance that devotion, he wished to reveal further secrets about himself, which he did in the tenth and eleventh chapters. In the previous verse, he again emphasized the supremacy of the path of devotion. Now, he concludes this chapter by highlighting five characteristics of those who are engaged in exclusive devotion:They perform all their duties for my sake.  Accomplished devotees do not divide their works into material and spiritual. They perform every work for the pleasure of God, thus consecrating every act of theirs to him. The Saint Kabir states:jaha\u00f1 jaha\u00f1 chal\u016b\u00f1 kar\u016b\u00f1 parikram\u0101, jo jo kar\u016b\u00f1 so sev\u0101jaba sov\u016b\u00f1 kar\u016b\u00f1 da\u1e47\u1e0davat, j\u0101n\u016b\u00f1 deva na d\u016bj\u0101 [v31]\u201cWhen I walk, I think I am circumambulating the Lord; when I work, I think I am serving the Lord; and when I sleep, I think I am offering him obeisance. In this manner, I perform no activity other than that which is offered to him.\u201dThey depend upon me. Those who rely upon their spiritual practices to reach God are not exclusively dependent upon him. That is because he is attained by his grace, and not by spiritual practice. His exclusive devotees do not even rely upon their devotion as a means of attaining him. Rather, they place their entire faith his grace alone, and see their devotion as merely a way of attracting divine grace.They are devoted to me. The devotees do not feel the need for performing any of the other spiritual practices, such as cultivation of the knowledge of S\u0101nkhya, practice of a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yog, performance of fire sacrifices, etc. In this way, they feel that their relationship is with God alone. They behold only their Beloved Lord pervading all objects and personalities.They are free of attachment. Devotion requires the engagement of the mind. This is only possible if the mind is detached from the world. So exclusive devotees are free from all worldly attachments and repose their mind in God alone.They are without malice toward all beings. If the heart fills up with malice, it will again not remain exclusive toward God. Thus, exclusive devotees do not harbor any malice, even toward those who have harmed them. Instead, thinking that God resides in the heart of all beings, they see all actions as stemming from him and so they forgive even their wrongdoers."

According to their karmas, He directs the wanderings of the souls, who are seated on a machine made of material energy.\u201d\u00a0 Residing within, God notes all our thoughts and actions, keeps an account of them, and gives the results at the appropriate time.\u00a0 We may forget what we have done, but God does not.\u00a0 He remembers our every thought, word, and deed, since we were born.\u00a0 And not only in this life!\u00a0 In endless lifetimes, wherever we went, God went along with us.\u00a0 He is such a friend who never leaves us for even a moment.\u00a0 This aspect of God dwelling within is the Param\u0101tm\u0101.\u00a0The path of a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog, as revealed by Patanjali in the Yog Dar\u015bhan, strives to realize God seated inside, and leads to the Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization of God.\u00a0 Just as the train, which appeared as light from far, was seen as a shimmering form when it came closer, similarly, the realization of the Supreme Entity as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is a closer realization than Brahman.\u00a0Bhagav\u0101n is the aspect of God that manifests with a personal form.\u00a0 The Shreemad Bhagavatam states:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47am enam avehi tvam \u0101tm\u0101nam akhil\u0101tman\u0101mjagad-dhit\u0101ya so \u2019pyatra deh\u012bv\u0101bh\u0101ti m\u0101yay\u0101\u00a0\u00a0 (10.14.55)\u201cThe Supreme Lord Who is the Soul of all souls, has descended upon the earth in His personal form, as Shree Krishna, for the welfare of the world.\u201d\u00a0 In this Bhagav\u0101n aspect, God manifests all the sweetness of His Names, Forms, Qualities, Abodes, Pastimes, and Associates.\u00a0 These attributes exist in Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 as well, but they remain latent, just as fire is latent in a match-stick, and only manifests when it is struck against the igniting strip of the matchbox.\u00a0 Similarly, as Bhagav\u0101n, all the powers and aspects of God\u2019s personality, which are latent in the other forms, get revealed.The path of bhakti, or devotion, leads to the realization of the Supreme Entity in His Bhagav\u0101n aspect.\u00a0 This is the closest realization of God, just as the details of a train become visible when it comes and stops in front of the observer.\u00a0 Hence, in verse 18.55, Shree Krishna states:\u00a0\u201cOnly by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna answers Arjun\u2019s question by clarifying that He considers the devotee of His personal form to be the highest yogi."

        "commentary": "Having embraced worshippers of all His various manifestations into the fold, Shree Krishna again reiterates His preference for the worship of the personal form.\u00a0 He surmises the worship of the impersonal Brahman by saying that it is an exceedingly challenging path that is full of tribulations.Why is the worship of the formless Brahman so difficult?\u00a0 The first and foremost reason for this is that we humans possess a form ourselves and we have been habituated to interacting with forms in endless lifetimes.\u00a0 Thus, while striving to love God as well, if our mind has a wonderful enchanting form to meditate upon, it can easily focus upon it and increase its attachment to the Lord.\u00a0 However, in the case of the formless, the intellect cannot conceive of it, and the mind and senses have no tangible object to relate to.\u00a0 So both the endeavors of meditating on God and increasing the mind\u2019s attachment to Him become difficult.Worship of Brahman is also difficult in comparison to that of Bhagav\u0101n for another reason. \u00a0The difference in paths can be understood through the marka\u1e6d-ki\u015bhore ny\u0101ya (the logic of the baby) monkey, and m\u0101rj\u0101r-ki\u015bhore ny\u0101ya (the logic of the baby kitten).\u00a0 The baby monkey is responsible for holding onto her mother\u2019s stomach; it is not helped by its mother.\u00a0 When the mother monkey jumps from one branch to another, the onus of clinging tightly onto the mother is upon the baby, and if it is unable to do so, it falls.\u00a0 In contrast, a kitten is very small and delicate, but the mother takes the responsibility of transporting it from one place to another, by holding the kitten from behind the neck and lifting it up.\u00a0 In the analogy, the devotees of the formless can be compared to the baby monkey and the devotees of the personal form can be compared to the baby kitten.\u00a0 Those who worship the formless Brahman have the onus of progressing on the path by themselves, because Brahman does not bestow grace upon them.\u00a0 Brahman is not only formless, It is also without attributes.\u00a0 It has been described as nirgu\u1e47a (without qualities), nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63h (without attributes), and nir\u0101k\u0101r (without form).\u00a0 From this, it follows that Brahman does not manifest the quality of grace.\u00a0 The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who worship God as nirgu\u1e47a, nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63h, and nir\u0101k\u0101r, have to rely entirely upon self-effort for progress.\u00a0 On the other hand, the personal form of God is an ocean of compassion and mercy.\u00a0 Hence, devotees of the personal form receive the help of divine support in their s\u0101dhan\u0101.\u00a0 On the basis of the protection that God bestows upon His devotees, Shree Krishna stated in verse 9.31: \u201cO son of Kunti, declare it boldly that no devotee of Mine is ever lost.\u201d\u00a0 He confirms the same statement in the next two verses."

        "commentary": "Having explained that worship of the personal form is better, Shree Krishna now begins to explain how to worship Him.\u00a0 He asks Arjun to do two things\u2014fix the mind on God and also surrender the intellect to Him.\u00a0 The function of the mind is to create desires, attractions, and aversions.\u00a0 The function of the intellect is to think, analyze, and discriminate.The importance of the mind has been repeatedly stated in the Vedic scriptures:\u00a0cheta\u1e25 khalvasya bandh\u0101ya muktaye ch\u0101tmano matamgu\u1e47e\u1e63hu sakta\u1e41 bandh\u0101ya rata\u1e41 v\u0101 pu\u1e41si muktaye(Bhagavatam 3.25.15)\u201cCaptivity in Maya and liberation from it is determined by the mind.\u00a0 If it is attached to the world, one is in bondage, and if the mind is detached from the world, one gets liberated.\u201d\u00a0mana eva manu\u1e63hy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 bandha mok\u1e63hayo\u1e25\u00a0 \u00a0(Pa\u00f1chada\u015bh\u012b)\u201cBondage and liberation are decided by the state of the mind.\u201d\u00a0 Mere physical devotion is not sufficient; we must absorb the mind in thinking of God.\u00a0 The reason is that without the engagement of the mind, mere sensory activity is of no value.\u00a0 For example, we hear a sermon with our ears, but if the mind wanders off, we will not know what was said.\u00a0 The words will fall on the ears but they will not register.\u00a0 This shows that without engaging the mind the work of the senses does not count.\u00a0 On the other hand, the mind is such an instrument that in it all the senses reside in the subtle form.\u00a0 Thus, even without the actual sensory activity the mind experiences the perceptions of sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.\u00a0 For example, at night when we sleep our senses are inactive.\u00a0 Yet while dreaming, our mind experiences the objects of all the senses.\u00a0 This proves that the mind has the capacity to experience all perceptions even without the gross senses.\u00a0 Therefore, while noting our karmas, God gives importance to the mental works and not the physical works of the senses.\u00a0Even beyond the mind is the intellect.\u00a0 We can only fix the mind upon God when we surrender our intellect to Him.\u00a0 In material pursuits as well, when we face situations beyond the capability of our intellect, we take guidance from a person with superior intellect.\u00a0 For example, we visit a doctor when we are sick.\u00a0 We have no knowledge of medical science ourselves, and so we follow the advice of a qualified medical doctor.\u00a0 The doctor checks our symptoms, looks at our medical reports, makes a diagnosis, and then prescribes the medicines.\u00a0 We surrender our intellect and take the medicines according to the doctor\u2019s prescription.\u00a0 Similarly, if we are involved in a legal case, we take the help of a lawyer.\u00a0 The lawyer instructs us how to handle the interrogation by the opposing lawyer.\u00a0 Having no knowledge of law ourselves, we surrender our intellect and simply do as the lawyer says.\u00a0In the same way, at present our intellect is subject to many defects.\u00a0 Akrur, who went to get Shree Krishna from Vrindavan to Mathura,\u00a0described these imperfections of the intellect in the Bhagavatam (10.40.25):\u00a0 anity\u0101n\u0101tma du\u1e25khe\u1e63hu viparyaya matirhyaham\u00a0 Akrur said: \u201cOur intellect is strapped with wrong knowledge.\u00a0 Though we are eternal souls, we think of ourselves to be the perishable body.\u00a0 Although all the objects of the world are perishable, we think they will always remain with us, and hence, we busily accumulate them day and night.\u00a0 And though the pursuit of sensual pleasures only results in misery in the long run, we still chase them in the hope that we will find happiness.\u201d\u00a0 The above three defects of the intellect are called viparyaya, or reversals of knowledge under material illusion.\u00a0 The gravity of our problem is further aggravated because our intellect is habituated to this kind of defective thinking from innumerable previous lifetimes.\u00a0 If we run our lives in accordance with the directions of our intellect, we will definitely not make much progress on the divine path.\u00a0 Thus, if we wish to achieve spiritual success by attaching the mind to God, we must surrender our intellect to Him and follow His directions.\u00a0 Surrendering the intellect means to think in accordance with the knowledge received from God via the medium of the scriptures and the bonafide Guru.\u00a0 The characteristics of a surrendered intellect are described in verse 18.62."

        "commentary": "The instruction to practice to remember God is also often easier said than done.\u00a0 The mind is made from the material energy Maya and it naturally runs toward the material objects of the world, while taking it toward God requires conscious and determined effort.\u00a0 We may hear the instruction that we should think of God, and we may desire to implement it, but when we get absorbed in our work, God slips out of the mind.\u00a0 So what should those people do who find it difficult to practice the remembrance of God at all times of the day?\u00a0 Shree Krishna answers this question in the above verse.Those who cannot constantly remember God should practice to simply work for Him.\u00a0 In whatever work they perform, they should cultivate the intention that they are doing it for the pleasure of the Lord, as stated previously in verses 9.27 and 9.28.\u00a0 In household life, a major portion of one\u2019s time goes in the maintenance of the family.\u00a0 One should keep doing the same work, but change the internal consciousness.\u00a0 Rather than doing it out of bodily attachment for them, one should develop the consciousness that the family members are all children of God, and one has a responsibility to take care of them for His pleasure.\u00a0 One has to continue earning one\u2019s living, but again, a modification can be done in the consciousness with which one works.\u00a0 Rather than thinking that it is for the purpose of earning money for worldly enjoyment, one can think, \u201cI wish to maintain my family and myself with the earnings to enable us all to engage in devotion.\u00a0 And whatever I can save, I will donate in the service of God.\u201d\u00a0 Similarly, the bodily processes of eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. cannot be given up.\u00a0 But here again, we can develop divine consciousness, \u201cI need to keep my body healthy so that I can serve God with it.\u00a0 That is why I will carefully do the tasks required for its maintenance.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0When we practice working for the pleasure of God, we will naturally stop engaging in selfish activities and move toward those that are more in the nature of devotional service.\u00a0 In this way, by performing all actions for the exclusive satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna, our mind will become steady and we will soon be able to focus upon Him.\u00a0 Then, gradually love for God will manifest within the heart, and we will gain success in constantly thinking of Him."

\u201cLeave him,\u201d in the same manner as he had said, \u201cTake him to the gallows.\u201d\u00a0The celestial gods showered flowers into his court, and hailed the quality of justice that Prahlad displayed.\u00a0 This attitude of justice came naturally to Prahlad because by virtue of being a perfect devotee of the Lord he was equal to friend, foe, relative, kith, kin, and outsider.Equipoised in honor and dishonor.\u00a0 Shree Krishna further mentions that the devotees pay no heed to honor and dishonor.\u00a0 This is just like when a person begins engaging in an illicit relationship, he or she is mindful of what others will say, but when the relationship becomes deep, then the person no longer cares about the disrepute it will bring.\u00a0 Similarly, in the heart of the devotee the flame of divine love burns so brightly that worldly honor and dishonor no longer carry any importance.\u00a0\u00a0Alike in cold and heat, joy and sorrow.\u00a0 The devotees are equipoised in favorable and unfavorable circumstances.\u00a0 They know that none of these are permanent.\u00a0 They come and go like the day and the night, and so they do not consider it worth their while to take their thoughts off God and focus on either of them.\u00a0 An incident from the life of Ramakrishna Paramahansa illustrates the nature of saints.\u00a0 He got cancer of the throat in his old age.\u00a0 People asked him to pray to Mother Kali to cure him.\u00a0 He said, \u201cMy mind is absorbed in love for Mother Kali.\u00a0 Why should I take it off from her and apply it to this dirty bodily cancer?\u00a0 Whatever God has willed, let it happen.\u201d\u00a0Free from unfavorable association.\u00a0 Associating with persons or objects is called sa\u1e45g.\u00a0 There are two kinds of

(favorable association).\u00a0 Since devotees do not relish worldly thoughts, they naturally avoid kusa\u1e45g and engage in satsa\u1e45g.Take praise and reproach alike.\u00a0 For those who are externally motivated, the appreciation and rejection by others is all-important.\u00a0 However, devotees are internally motivated by the principles they value within themselves.\u00a0 Hence, neither commendation nor denunciation by others makes any difference to them.\u00a0Given to silent contemplation.\u00a0 Crows and swans have diametrically opposite choices.\u00a0 While crows are drawn to garbage piles, the majestic swans are attracted by tranquil lakes.\u00a0 Similarly, the minds of worldly people find great relish in conversing about materialistic topics.\u00a0 But the saintly devotees possess pure minds, and thus worldly talks seem as attractive to them as a pile of garbage.\u00a0 This does not mean that they do not converse.\u00a0 Like the swan drawn to the lakes, their minds are drawn toward topics such as the Names, Forms, Pastimes, and Glories of God.Content with whatever comes their way.\u00a0 The needs of the devotees shrink to the bare necessities for maintaining the body.\u00a0 Saint Kabir expresses this in his famous couplet:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 m\u0101lik itan\u0101 d\u012bjiye, j\u0101me

residence.\u00a0 No earthly home can be a permanent residence for the soul, for it must necessarily be left behind at the time of death.\u00a0 When the Mogul Emperor, Akbar, built his capital, Fatehpur Sikri, he put the following inscription on the main entrance gate: \u201cThe world is a bridge; cross over it but build no house on it.\u201d\u00a0 In the same vein, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jaga me\u00f1 raho aise govinda radhey, dharma\u015bh\u0101l\u0101 me\u00f1 y\u0101tr\u012b rahe\u00f1 jyo\u00f1

statement, devotees look on their home as only a temporary dwelling place.\u00a0\u00a0Intellect is firmly fixed in Me.\u00a0 Devotees have deep conviction in the supremacy of God\u2019s position in creation and in their eternal relationship with Him.\u00a0 They are also firm in their faith that if they surrender to Him lovingly, by God\u2019s grace they will achieve the highest realization.\u00a0 Hence, they neither wander from attraction-to-attraction or from path-to-path.\u00a0 Shree Krishna declares such resolute devotees to be very dear to Him."

residence.\u00a0 No earthly home can be a permanent residence for the soul, for it must necessarily be left behind at the time of death.\u00a0 When the Mogul Emperor, Akbar, built his capital, Fatehpur Sikri, he put the following inscription on the main entrance gate: \u201cThe world is a bridge; cross over it but build no house on it.\u201d\u00a0 In the same vein, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jaga me\u00f1 raho aise govinda radhey, dharma\u015bh\u0101l\u0101 me\u00f1 y\u0101tr\u012b rahe\u00f1 jyo\u00f1

statement, devotees look on their home as only a temporary dwelling place.\u00a0\u00a0Intellect is firmly fixed in Me.\u00a0 Devotees have deep conviction in the supremacy of God\u2019s position in creation and in their eternal relationship with Him.\u00a0 They are also firm in their faith that if they surrender to Him lovingly, by God\u2019s grace they will achieve the highest realization.\u00a0 Hence, they neither wander from attraction-to-attraction or from path-to-path.\u00a0 Shree Krishna declares such resolute devotees to be very dear to Him."

        "commentary": "Knowledge is appealing to the intellect when it is expressed with precision and clarity, and is substantiated with sound logic.\u00a0 Further, for it to be accepted as infallible, it must be confirmed on the basis of infallible authority.\u00a0 The reference for validating spiritual knowledge is the Vedas.\u00a0Vedas:\u00a0 These are not just the name of some books; they are the eternal knowledge of God.\u00a0 Whenever God creates the world, He manifests the Vedas for the benefit of the souls.\u00a0 The B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had (4.5.11) states:\u00a0 ni\u1e25\u015bhvasitamasya ved\u0101\u1e25 \u00a0\u201cThe Vedas manifested from the breath of God.\u201d\u00a0 They were first revealed in the heart of the first-born Brahma.\u00a0 From there, they came down through the oral tradition, and hence, another name for them is \u015ahruti, or \u201cknowledge received through the ear.\u201d\u00a0 At the beginning of the age of Kali, Ved Vyas, who was himself a descension of God, put down the Vedas in the form of a book, and divided the one body of knowledge into four portions\u2014\u1e5aig Veda, Yajur Veda, S\u0101ma Veda, and Atharva Veda.\u00a0 Hence, he got the name Ved Vy\u0101s, or \u201cone who divided the Vedas.\u201d\u00a0 The distinction must be borne in mind that Ved Vyas is never referred to as the composer of the Vedas but merely the one who divided them.\u00a0 Hence, the Vedas are also called apauru\u1e63heya, which means \u201cnot created by any person.\u201d\u00a0 They are respected as the infallible authority for spiritual knowledge.\u00a0bh\u016bta\u1e41 bhavya\u1e41 bhavi\u1e63hya\u1e41 cha sarva\u1e41 ved\u0101t prasidhyati\u00a0 (Manu Sm\u1e5biti 12.97)\u201cAny spiritual principle must be validated on the authority of the Vedas.\u201d\u00a0 To elaborate this knowledge of the Vedas, many sages wrote texts and these traditionally became included in the gamut of the Vedic scriptures because they conform to the authority of the Vedas.\u00a0 Some of the important Vedic scriptures are listed below.Itih\u0101s:\u00a0 These are historical texts, and are two in number, the Ramayan and the Mahabharat.\u00a0 They describe the history related to two important descensions of God.\u00a0 The Ramayan was written by Sage Valmiki, and describes the Leelas, or divine Pastimes, of Lord Ram.\u00a0 Amazingly, it was written by Valmiki before Shree Ram actually displayed His Leelas.\u00a0 The great poet Sage was empowered with divine vision, by which he could see the Pastimes Lord Ram would enact on descending in the world.\u00a0 He thus put them down in 24,000 most beautifully composed Sanskrit verses of the Ramayan.\u00a0 These verses also contain lessons on ideal behavior in various social roles, such as son, brother, wife, king, and married couples.\u00a0 The Ramayan has also been written in many regional languages of India, thereby increasing its popularity amongst the people.\u00a0 The most famous amongst these is the Hindi Ramayan, Ramcharit Manas, written by a great devotee of Lord Ram, Saint Tulsidas.The Mahabharat was written by Sage Ved Vyas.\u00a0 It contains 100,000 verses and is considered the longest poem in the world.\u00a0 The divine Leelas of Lord Krishna are the central theme of the Mahabharat.\u00a0 It is full of wisdom and guidance related to duties in all stages of human life, and devotion to God.\u00a0 The Bhagavad Gita is a portion of the Mahabharat.\u00a0 It is the most popular Hindu scripture, since it contains the essence of spiritual knowledge, so beautifully described by Lord Krishna Himself.\u00a0 It has been translated in many different languages of the world.\u00a0 Innumerable commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita.Puranas:\u00a0 There are eighteen Puranas, written by Sage Ved Vyas.\u00a0 Together, they contain 400,000 verses.\u00a0 These describe the divine Pastimes of the various forms of God and His devotees.\u00a0 The Puranas are also full of philosophic knowledge.\u00a0 They discuss the creation of the universe, its annihilation and recreation, the history of humankind, the genealogy of the celestial gods and the holy sages.\u00a0 The most important amongst them is the Bh\u0101gavat Pur\u0101\u1e47, or the Shreemad Bhagavatam.\u00a0 It was the last scripture written by Sage Ved Vyas.\u00a0 In it, he mentions that in this scripture, he is going to reveal the highest dharma of pure selfless love for God.\u00a0 Philosophically, the Shreemad Bhagavatam begins where the Bhagavad Gita ends.\u1e62ha\u1e0d-dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 These come next in importance amongst the Vedic scriptures.\u00a0 Six sages wrote six scriptures highlighting particular aspects of Hindu philosophy.\u00a0 These became known as the \u1e62ha\u1e0d-dar\u015bhan, or six philosophic works.\u00a0 They are:1. M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi (Sage) Jaimini, it describes ritualistic duties and ceremonies.2. Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Ved Vyas, it discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth.3. Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Gautam, it develops a system of logic for understanding life and the Absolute Truth.4. Vai\u015bhe\u1e63hik Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Kanad, it analyses cosmology and creation from the perspective of its various elements.5. Yog Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Pata\u00f1jali, it describes an eightfold path to union with God, beginning with physical postures.6. S\u0101nkhya Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Kapil, it describes the evolution of the Universe from prak\u1e5biti, the primordial form of the material energy.Apart from these mentioned above, there are hundreds of other scriptures in the Hindu tradition.\u00a0 It would be impossible to describe them all here.\u00a0 Let it suffice to say that the Vedic scriptures are a vast treasure house of divine knowledge revealed by God and the saints for the eternal welfare of all humankind.\u00a0Amongst these scriptural texts, the Brahma S\u016btra (Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan) is considered as the last word on the topic of the distinction between the soul, the material body, and God.\u00a0 Hence, Shree Krishna particularly mentions it in the above verse.\u00a0 \u201cVed\u201d refers to the Vedas, and \u201cant\u201d means \u201cthe conclusion.\u201d\u00a0 Consequently, \u201cVed\u0101nt\u201d means \u201cthe conclusion of Vedic knowledge.\u201d\u00a0 Although, the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan was written by Sage Ved Vyas, many great scholars accepted it as the reference authority for philosophical dissertation and wrote commentaries on it to establish their unique philosophic viewpoint regarding the soul and God.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shankaracharya\u2019s commentary on the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan is called \u015ah\u0101r\u012brak Bh\u0101\u1e63hya, which lays the foundation for the advait-v\u0101d tradition of philosophy.\u00a0 Many of his followers, such as Vachaspati and Padmapada have elaborated upon his commentary.\u00a0 Jagadguru Nimbarkarcharya wrote the Ved\u0101nt P\u0101rij\u0101ta Saurabh, which explains the dwait-advait-v\u0101d school of thought.\u00a0 Jagadguru Ramanujacharya\u2019s commentary is called \u015ahr\u012b Bh\u0101\u1e63hya, which lays the basis for the vi\u015bhi\u1e63h\u1e6d-advait-v\u0101d system of philosophy.\u00a0 Jagadguru Madhvacharya\u2019s commentary is called Brahma S\u016btra Bh\u0101\u1e63hyam, which is the foundation for the dwait-v\u0101d school of thought.\u00a0 Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya wrote A\u1e47u Bh\u0101\u1e63hya, in which he established the \u015bhuddhadvait-v\u0101d system of philosophy.\u00a0 Apart from these, some of the other well-known commentators have been Bhat Bhaskar, Yadav Prakash, Keshav, Nilakanth, Vijnanabhikshu, and Baladev Vidyabhushan.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, himself a Vedic scholar par excellence, did not write any commentary on the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan.\u00a0 He took the view that the writer of the Ved\u0101nt, Sage Ved Vyas himself, declared that his final scripture the Shreemad Bhagavatam is its perfect commentary:arthoya\u1e41 brahmas\u016btr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 sarvopani\u1e63had\u0101mapi\u201cThe Shreemad Bhagavatam reveals the meaning and the essence of the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan and all the Upanishads.\u201d\u00a0 Hence, out of respect for Ved Vyas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not deem it fit to write another commentary on the scripture."

one\u2019s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.\u00a0 (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.\u00a0 The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)\u00a0 These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one\u2019s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.\u00a0 When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.\u00a0 Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.\u00a0 It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.\u00a0 The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.\u00a0 A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.\u00a0Non-violence.\u00a0 The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.\u00a0 This requires the practice of non-violence. \u00a0Hence the scriptures state: \u0101tmana\u1e25 pratik\u016bl\u0101ni pare\u015bh\u0101\u1e41 na sam\u0101charet\u00a0 \u201cIf you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.\u201d\u00a0Forgiveness.\u00a0 It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.\u00a0 Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.\u00a0 By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.\u00a0 It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.\u00a0 Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.\u00a0 This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.\u00a0 By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:\u00a0 \u201cLearn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.\u00a0 Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.\u00a0 Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201dCleanliness of body and mind.\u00a0 Purity should be both internal and external.\u00a0 The \u015ah\u0101\u1e47dilya Upani\u1e63had states:\u00a0 \u015bhaucha\u1e41 n\u0101ma dwividha\u1e41-b\u0101hyam\u0101ntara\u1e41 cheti (1.1)\u00a0 \u201cThere are two types of cleanliness\u2014internal and external.\u201d\u00a0 External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.\u00a0 But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:m\u0101y\u0101dh\u012bn mal\u012bn mana, hai an\u0101di k\u0101l\u012bn,hari

of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.\u201d\u00a0Steadfastness.\u00a0 Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.\u00a0 Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.\u00a0 The scriptures state:\u00a0 charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati\u00a0 \u201cKeep moving forward.\u00a0 Keep moving forward.\u00a0 Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.\u201d\u00a0Self-control.\u00a0 It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.\u00a0 Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.\u00a0 It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.\u00a0 Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.\u00a0 Egotism is the conscious awareness of \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d and \u201cmine.\u201d\u00a0 This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.\u00a0 It is also called the aham chetan\u0101 (pride arising out of the sense of self).\u00a0 All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jaba mai\u1e45 th\u0101 taba hari nath\u012b\u1e45, ab hari hai, mai\u1e45

Kabir)\u201cWhen \u2018I\u2019 existed, God was not there; now God exists and \u2018I\u2019 do not.\u00a0 The path of divine love is very narrow; it cannot accommodate both \u2018I\u2019 and God.\u201d\u00a0In the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog and a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog, there are elaborate s\u0101dhan\u0101s for getting rid of the aham chetan\u0101.\u00a0 But in the path of bhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.\u00a0 We add d\u0101s (servant) in front of aham (the sense of self), making it d\u0101soham (I am the servant of God).\u00a0 Now the \u201cI\u201d no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness.\u00a0Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.\u00a0 If the intellect is undecided about what is more important\u2014material enhancement or spiritual wealth\u2014then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.\u00a0 But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.\u00a0 To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.\u00a0 This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.\u00a0 He saw a sick person, and thought, \u201cO there is sickness in the world.\u00a0 I will also have to fall sick one day.\u201d\u00a0 Then He saw an old person, and thought, \u201cThere is also old age.\u00a0 This means that I will also become old one day.\u201d\u00a0 After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, \u201cThis is also a part of existence.\u00a0 It means that I too will have to die one day.\u201d\u00a0 The Buddha\u2019s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.\u00a0 Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.\u00a0 It means dispassion toward the world.\u00a0 We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.\u00a0 The s\u0101dhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.\u00a0Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.\u00a0 These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.\u00a0 In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as \u201cmine.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.\u00a0 Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.\u00a0 Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.\u00a0 All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.\u00a0 Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.\u00a0 We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school.\u00a0Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.\u00a0 Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.\u00a0 That is life.\u00a0 To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.\u00a0 We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life\u2019s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success.\u00a0Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.\u00a0 Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.\u00a0 But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.\u00a0 Life is about engaging in the desirable.\u00a0 The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.\u00a0 Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.\u00a0 Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.\u00a0 They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.\u00a0 Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.\u00a0Aversion for mundane society.\u00a0 The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.\u00a0 One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.\u00a0 At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.\u00a0 To theoretically know something is not enough.\u00a0 One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.\u00a0 We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.\u00a0 This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.\u00a0 After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.\u00a0 Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.\u00a0 Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.\u00a0 However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.\u00a0 This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: \u201cWho am I?\u00a0 Why am I here?\u00a0 What is my goal in life?\u00a0 How was this world created?\u00a0 What is my connection with the Creator?\u00a0 How will I fulfill my purpose in life?\u201d\u00a0 This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.\u00a0 The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.\u00a0 Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness."

one\u2019s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.\u00a0 (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.\u00a0 The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)\u00a0 These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one\u2019s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.\u00a0 When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.\u00a0 Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.\u00a0 It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.\u00a0 The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.\u00a0 A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.\u00a0Non-violence.\u00a0 The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.\u00a0 This requires the practice of non-violence. \u00a0Hence the scriptures state: \u0101tmana\u1e25 pratik\u016bl\u0101ni pare\u015bh\u0101\u1e41 na sam\u0101charet\u00a0 \u201cIf you dislike a certain behavior from

oneself more than the other.\u00a0 By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.\u00a0 It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.\u00a0 Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.\u00a0 This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.\u00a0 By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:\u00a0 \u201cLearn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.\u00a0 Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.\u00a0 Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201dCleanliness of body and mind.\u00a0 Purity should be both internal and

forward.\u00a0 Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.\u201d\u00a0Self-control.\u00a0 It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.\u00a0 Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.\u00a0 It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.\u00a0 Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.\u00a0 Egotism

God.\u201d\u00a0In the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog and a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog, there are elaborate s\u0101dhan\u0101s for getting rid of the aham chetan\u0101.\u00a0 But in the path of bhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.\u00a0 We add d\u0101s (servant) in front of aham (the sense of self), making it d\u0101soham (I am the servant of God).\u00a0 Now the \u201cI\u201d no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness.\u00a0Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.\u00a0 If the intellect is undecided about what is more important\u2014material enhancement or spiritual wealth\u2014then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.\u00a0 But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.\u00a0 To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.\u00a0 This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.\u00a0 He saw a sick person, and thought, \u201cO there is sickness in the world.\u00a0 I will also have to fall sick one day.\u201d\u00a0 Then He saw an old person, and thought, \u201cThere is also old age.\u00a0 This means that I will also become old one day.\u201d\u00a0 After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, \u201cThis is also a part of existence.\u00a0 It means that I too will have to die one day.\u201d\u00a0 The Buddha\u2019s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.\u00a0 Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.\u00a0 It means dispassion toward the world.\u00a0 We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.\u00a0 The s\u0101dhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.\u00a0Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.\u00a0 These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.\u00a0 In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as \u201cmine.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.\u00a0 Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.\u00a0 Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.\u00a0 All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.\u00a0 Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.\u00a0 We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school.\u00a0Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.\u00a0 Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.\u00a0 That is life.\u00a0 To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.\u00a0 We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life\u2019s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success.\u00a0Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.\u00a0 Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.\u00a0 But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.\u00a0 Life is about engaging in the desirable.\u00a0 The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.\u00a0 Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.\u00a0 Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.\u00a0 They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.\u00a0 Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.\u00a0Aversion for mundane society.\u00a0 The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.\u00a0 One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.\u00a0 At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.\u00a0 To theoretically know something is not enough.\u00a0 One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.\u00a0 We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.\u00a0 This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.\u00a0 After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.\u00a0 Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.\u00a0 Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.\u00a0 However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.\u00a0 This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: \u201cWho am I?\u00a0 Why am I here?\u00a0 What is my goal in life?\u00a0 How was this world created?\u00a0 What is my connection with the Creator?\u00a0 How will I fulfill my purpose in life?\u201d\u00a0 This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.\u00a0 The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.\u00a0 Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness."

        "commentary": "To gain knowledge of the k\u1e63hetra and k\u1e63hetraj\u00f1a is not merely an intellectual exercise.\u00a0 Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one\u2019s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.\u00a0 (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.\u00a0 The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)\u00a0 These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one\u2019s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.\u00a0 When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.\u00a0 Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.\u00a0 It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.\u00a0 The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.\u00a0 A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.\u00a0Non-violence.\u00a0 The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.\u00a0 This requires the practice of non-violence. \u00a0Hence the scriptures state: \u0101tmana\u1e25 pratik\u016bl\u0101ni pare\u015bh\u0101\u1e41 na sam\u0101charet\u00a0 \u201cIf you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.\u201d\u00a0Forgiveness.\u00a0 It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.\u00a0 Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.\u00a0 By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.\u00a0 It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.\u00a0 Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.\u00a0 This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.\u00a0 By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:\u00a0 \u201cLearn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.\u00a0 Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.\u00a0 Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201dCleanliness of body and mind.\u00a0 Purity should be both internal and external.\u00a0 The \u015ah\u0101\u1e47dilya Upani\u1e63had states:\u00a0 \u015bhaucha\u1e41 n\u0101ma dwividha\u1e41-b\u0101hyam\u0101ntara\u1e41 cheti (1.1)\u00a0 \u201cThere are two types of cleanliness\u2014internal and external.\u201d\u00a0 External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.\u00a0 But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:m\u0101y\u0101dh\u012bn mal\u012bn mana, hai an\u0101di k\u0101l\u012bn,hari

of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.\u201d\u00a0Steadfastness.\u00a0 Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.\u00a0 Steadfastness is the

forward.\u00a0 Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.\u201d\u00a0Self-control.\u00a0 It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.\u00a0 Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.\u00a0 It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.\u00a0 Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.\u00a0 Egotism is the conscious awareness of \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d and \u201cmine.\u201d\u00a0 This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.\u00a0 It is also called the aham chetan\u0101 (pride arising out of the sense of self).\u00a0 All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid

in the material world.\u00a0 This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.\u00a0 He saw a sick person, and thought, \u201cO there is sickness in the world.\u00a0 I will also have to fall sick one day.\u201d\u00a0 Then He saw an old person, and thought, \u201cThere is also old age.\u00a0 This means that I will also become old one day.\u201d\u00a0 After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, \u201cThis is also a part of existence.\u00a0 It means that I too will have to die one day.\u201d\u00a0 The Buddha\u2019s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.\u00a0 Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.\u00a0 It means dispassion toward the world.\u00a0 We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.\u00a0 The s\u0101dhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.\u00a0Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.\u00a0 These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.\u00a0 In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as \u201cmine.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.\u00a0 Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.\u00a0 Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.\u00a0 All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.\u00a0 Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.\u00a0 We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school.\u00a0Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.\u00a0 Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.\u00a0 That is life.\u00a0 To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.\u00a0 We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life\u2019s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success.\u00a0Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.\u00a0 Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.\u00a0 But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.\u00a0 Life is about engaging in the desirable.\u00a0 The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.\u00a0 Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.\u00a0 Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.\u00a0 They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.\u00a0 Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.\u00a0Aversion for mundane society.\u00a0 The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.\u00a0 One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.\u00a0 At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.\u00a0 To theoretically know something is not enough.\u00a0 One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.\u00a0 We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.\u00a0 This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.\u00a0 After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.\u00a0 Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.\u00a0 Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.\u00a0 However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.\u00a0 This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: \u201cWho am I?\u00a0 Why am I here?\u00a0 What is my goal in life?\u00a0 How was this world created?\u00a0 What is my connection with the Creator?\u00a0 How will I fulfill my purpose in life?\u201d\u00a0 This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.\u00a0 The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.\u00a0 Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness."

Bose established through experiments that even plants, which are non-moving life forms, can feel and respond to emotions.\u00a0 His experiments proved that soothing music can enhance the growth of plants.\u00a0 When a hunter shoots a bird sitting on a tree, the vibrations of the tree seem to indicate that it weeps for the bird.\u00a0 And when a loving gardener enters the garden, the trees feel joyous.\u00a0 The changes in the vibrations of the tree reveal that it also possesses consciousness and can experience semblances of emotions.\u00a0 These observations corroborate Shree Krishna\u2019s statement here that all life forms possess consciousness; they are the combination of the eternal soul, which is the source of consciousness, and the body, which is made of the insentient material energy."

Then, inspired by the karmas of the individual souls, the material nature gets to work to create suitable life forms for them.\u201d He does not cast all souls into the material world, rather only those who are vimukh."

        "commentary": "Having explained that all life-forms are born from puru\u1e63h and prak\u1e5biti, Shree Krishna now explains in the next fourteen verses how prak\u1e5biti binds the soul. Although it is divine, its identification with the body ties it to material nature. The material energy possess three gu\u1e47as\u2014goodness, passion, and ignorance. Hence the body, mind, and intellect that are made from prak\u1e5biti also possess these three modes.Consider the example of three-color printing. If any one of the colors is released in excess by the machine on the paper, then the picture acquires a hue of that color. Similarly, prak\u1e5biti has the ink of the three colors. Based upon one\u2019s internal thoughts, the external circumstances, past sansk\u0101rs, and other factors, one or the other of these modes becomes dominant for that person. And the mode that predominates creates its corresponding shade upon that person\u2019s personality. Hence, the soul is swayed by the influence of these dominating modes. Shree Krishna now describes the impact of these modes upon the living being."

        "commentary": "The word prak\u0101\u015bhakam means \u201cilluminating.\u201d The word an\u0101mayam means \u201chealthy and full of well-being.\u201d By extension, it also means \u201cof peaceful quality,\u201d devoid of any inherent cause for pain, discomfort, or misery. The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating. Thus, sattva gu\u1e47a engenders virtue in one\u2019s personality and illuminates the intellect with knowledge. It makes a person become calm, satisfied, charitable, compassionate, helpful, serene, and tranquil. It also nurtures good health and freedom from sickness. While the mode of goodness creates an effect of serenity and happiness, attachment to them itself binds the soul to material nature.Let us understand this through an example. A traveler was passing through a forest, when three robbers attacked him. The first said, \u201cLet us kill him and steal all his wealth.\u201d The second said, \u201cNo, let us not kill him. We will simply bind him, and take away his possessions.\u201d Following the advice of the second robber, they tied him up in ropes and stole his wealth. When they had gone some distance away, the third robber returned. He opened the ropes of the traveler, and took him to the edge of the forest. He showed the way out, and said, \u201cI cannot go out myself, but if you follow this path, you will be able to get out of the forest.\u201dThe first robber was tamo gu\u1e47a, the mode of ignorance, which literally wants to kill the soul, by degrading it into sloth, languor, and nescience. The second robber was rajo gu\u1e47a, the mode of passion, which excites the passions of the living being, and binds the soul in innumerable worldly desires. The third robber was sattva gu\u1e47a, the mode of goodness, which reduces the vices of the living being, eases the material discomfort and puts the soul on the path of virtue. Yet, even sattva gu\u1e47a is within the realm of material nature. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use it to step up to the transcendental platform.Beyond these three, is \u015bhuddha sattva, the transcendental mode of goodness. It is the mode of the divine energy of God that is beyond material nature. When the soul becomes God-realized, by his grace, God bestows \u015bhuddha sattva upon the soul, making the senses, mind, and intellect divine."

The Pata\u00f1jali Yog Dar\u015bhan describes material activity as the primary manifestation of rajo gu\u1e47a. Here, Shree Krishna describes its principal manifestation as attachment and desire.\nThe mode of passion fuels the lust for sensual enjoyment. It inflames desires for mental and physical pleasures. It also promotes attachment to worldly things. Persons influenced by rajo gu\u1e47a get engrossed in worldly pursuits of status, prestige, career, family, and home. They look on these as sources of pleasure and are motivated to undertake intense activity for the sake of these. In this way, the mode of passion increases desires, and these desires further fuel an increase of the mode of passion. They both nourish each other and trap the soul in worldly life.\nThe way to break out of this is to engage in karm yog, i.e. to begin offering the results of one\u2019s activities to God. This creates detachment from the world, and pacifies the effect of rajo gu\u1e47a."

They lose their discrimination of what is right and what is wrong, and do not hesitate in resorting to immoral behavior for fulfilling their self-will. Doing their duty becomes burdensome to them and they neglect it, becoming more inclined to sloth and sleep. In this way, the mode of ignorance leads the soul deeper into the darkness of ignorance. It becomes totally oblivious of its spiritual identity, its goal in life, and the opportunity for progress that the human form provides."

        "commentary": "In the mode of goodness, the miseries of material existence reduce, and worldly desires become subdued. This gives rise to a feeling of contentment with one\u2019s condition. This is a good thing, but it can have a negative side too. For instance, those who experience pain in the world and are disturbed by the desires in their mind feel impelled to look for a solution to their problems, and this impetus sometimes brings them to the spiritual path. However, those in goodness can easily become complacent and feel no urge to progress to the transcendental platform. Also, sattva gu\u1e47a illumines the intellect with knowledge. If this is not accompanied by spiritual wisdom, then knowledge results in pride and that pride comes in the way of devotion to God. This is often seen in the case of scientists, academicians, scholars, etc. The mode of goodness usually predominates in them, since they spend their time and energy cultivating knowledge. And yet, the knowledge they possess often makes them proud, and they begin to feel that there can be no truth beyond the grasp of their intellect. Thus, they find it difficult to develop faith toward either the scriptures or the God-realized Saints.In the mode of passion, the souls are impelled toward intense activity. Their attachment to the world and preference for pleasure, prestige, wealth, and bodily comforts, propels them to work hard in the world for achieving these goals, which they consider to be the most important in life. Rajo gu\u1e47a increases the attraction between man and woman, and generates k\u0101m (lust). To satiate that lust, man and woman enter into the relationship of marriage and have a home. The upkeep of the home creates the need for wealth, so they begin to work hard for economic development. They engage in intense activity, but each action creates karmas, which further bind them in material existence.The mode of ignorance clouds the intellect of the living being. The desire for happiness now manifests in perverse manners. For example, everyone knows that cigarette smoking is injurious to health. Every cigarette pack carries a warning to that extent issued by the government authorities. Cigarette smokers read this, and yet do not refrain from smoking. This happens because the intellect loses its discriminative power and does not hesitate to inflict self-injury to get the pleasure of smoking. As someone jokingly said, \u201cA cigarette is a pipe with a fire at one end and a fool at the other.\u201d That is the influence of tamo gu\u1e47a, which binds the soul in the darkness of ignorance."

These three gu\u1e47as are present in the material energy, and our mind is made from the same energy. Hence, all the three gu\u1e47as are present in our mind as well. They can be compared to three wrestlers competing with each other. Each keeps throwing the others down, and so, sometimes the first is on top, sometimes the second, and sometimes the third. In the same manner, the three gu\u1e47as keep gaining dominance over the individual\u2019s temperament, which oscillates amongst the three modes. Depending upon the external environment, the internal contemplation, and the sansk\u0101rs (tendencies) of past lives, one or the other gu\u1e47a begins to dominate. There is no rule for how long it stays\u2014one gu\u1e47a may dominate the mind and intellect for as short as a moment or for as long as an hour.If sattva gu\u1e47a dominates, one becomes peaceful, content, generous, kind, helpful, serene, and tranquil. When rajo gu\u1e47a gains prominence, one becomes passionate, agitated, ambitious, envious of others success, and develops a gusto for sense pleasures. When tamo guna becomes prominent, one is overcome by sleep, laziness, hatred, anger, resentment, violence, and doubt.For example, let us suppose you are sitting in your library, engaged in study. There is no worldly disturbance, and your mind has become s\u0101ttvic. After finishing your study, you sit in your living room and switch on the television. Seeing all the images makes your mind r\u0101jasic, and increases your hankering for sense pleasures. While you are watching your favorite channel, your family member comes and changes the channel. This disturbance causes tamo gu\u1e47a to increase in your mind, and you are filled with anger. In this way, the mind sways amongst the three gu\u1e47as and adopts their qualities."

All the living entities in the world are under the grip of the three gu\u1e47as, and hence the gu\u1e47as are the active agents in all the works being done in the world. But the Supreme Lord is beyond them. Therefore, he is called tri-gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bt (transcendental to the modes of material nature). Similarly, all the attributes of God\u2014his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, saints\u2014are also tri-gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bt.If we attach our mind to any personality or object within the realm of the three gu\u1e47as, it results in increasing their corresponding color on our mind and intellect. However, if we attach our mind to the divine realm, it transcends the gu\u1e47as and becomes divine. Those who understand this principle start loosening their relationship with worldly objects and people, and strengthening it, through bhakti, with God and the Guru. This enables them to transcend the three gu\u1e47as, and attain the divine nature of God. This is further elaborated in verse 14.26."

Similarly, if we are influenced by the three modes, we are bound to experience their consequences, which are repeated birth within the material realm, disease, old age, and death. These four are the primary miseries of material life. It was by seeing these that the Buddha first realized that the world is a place of misery, and then searched for the way out of misery.The Vedas prescribe a number of codes of conduct, social duties, rituals, and regulations for human beings. These prescribed duties and codes of conduct are together called karm dharma, or var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram dharma, or \u015bh\u0101r\u012brik dharma. They help elevate us from tamo gu\u1e47a and rajo gu\u1e47a to sattva gu\u1e47a. However, to reach sattva gu\u1e47a is not enough; it is also a form of bondage. The mode of goodness can be equated to being fettered with chains of gold. Our goal lies even beyond it\u2014to get out of the prison house of material existence.Shree Krishna explains that when we transcend the three modes, then Maya no longer binds the living being. Thus, the soul gets released from the cycle of life and death and attains immortality. Factually, the soul is always immortal. However, its identification with the material body makes it suffer the illusion of birth and death. This illusory experience is against the eternal nature of the soul, which seeks release from it. Hence, the material illusion is naturally discomforting to our inner being and, from within, we all seek the taste of immortality."

They are not disturbed when they see the gu\u1e47as functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations around them. Illumined persons do not hate ignorance when they see it, nor get implicated in it. Worldly-minded become overly concerned with the condition of the world. They spend their time and energy brooding about the state of things in the world. The enlightened souls also strive for human welfare, but they do so because it is their nature to help others. At the same time, they realize that the world is ultimately in the hands of God. They simply have to do their duty to the best of their ability, and leave the rest in the hands of God. Having come into God\u2019s world, our first duty is how to purify ourselves.

As Mahatma Gandhi said: \u201cBe the change that you wish to see in the world.\u201d\nShree Krishna explains that persons of illumination, who know themselves to be transcendental to the functioning of the modes, are neither miserable nor jubilant when the modes of nature perform their natural functions in the world. In fact, even when they perceive these gu\u1e47as in their mind, they do not feel disturbed. The mind is made from the material energy, and thus contains the three modes of Maya. So it is natural for the mind to be subjected to the influence of the gu\u1e47as, and their corresponding thoughts. The problem is that in bodily consciousness we do not see the mind as different from ourselves. And so, when the mind presents a disturbing thought, we feel, \u201cOh! I am thinking in this negative manner.\u201d We begin to associate with the poisonous thoughts, allowing them to reside in us and damage us spiritually. To the extent that even if the mind presents a thought against God and Guru, we accept the thought as ours. If, at that time, we could see the mind as separate from us, we would be able to dissociate ourselves from negative thoughts. We would then reject the thoughts of the mind, \u201cI will have nothing to do with any thought that is not conducive to my devotion.\u201d Persons on the transcendental platform have mastered the art of distancing themselves from all negative thoughts arising in the mind from the flow of the gu\u1e47as."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna now clarifies the traits of those who have transcended the three gu\u1e47as. They are not disturbed when they see the gu\u1e47as functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations around them. Illumined persons do not hate ignorance when they see it, nor get implicated in it. Worldly-minded become overly concerned with the condition of the world. They spend their time and energy brooding about the state of things in the world. The enlightened souls also strive for human welfare, but they do so because it is their nature to help others. At the same time, they realize that the world is ultimately in the hands of God. They simply have to do their duty to the best of their ability, and leave the rest in the hands of God. Having come into God\u2019s world, our first duty is how to purify ourselves. Then, with a pure mind, we will naturally do good and beneficial works in the world, without allowing worldly situations to bear too heavily upon us.

In bodily consciousness, we identify with the pain and pleasures of the body, and consequently vacillate between the emotions of elation and dejection. But those who are established on the transcendental platform of the self do not identify either with the happiness or the distress of the body. Such self-realized mystics do perceive the dualities of the world but remain unaffected by them. Thus, they become nirgu\u1e47a (beyond the influence of the gu\u1e47as). This gives them an equal vision, with which they see a piece of stone, a lump of earth, gold, favorable and unfavorable situations, criticisms and glorifications as all the same."

        "commentary": "Having explained the traits of those who are situated beyond the three gu\u1e47as, Shree Krishna now reveals the one and only method of transcending these modes of material nature. The above verse indicates that mere knowledge of the self and its distinction with the body is not enough. With the help of bhakti yog, the mind has to be fixed on the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna. Then alone will the mind become nirgu\u1e47a (untouched by the three modes), just as Shree Krishna is nirgu\u1e47a.Many people are of the view that if the mind is fixed upon the personal form of God, it will not rise to the transcendental platform. Only when it is attached to the formless Brahman, will the mind become transcendental to the modes of material nature. However, this verse refutes such a view. Although the personal form of God possesses infinite gu\u1e47as (qualities), these are all divine and beyond the modes of material nature. Hence, the personal form of God is also nirgu\u1e47a (beyond the three material modes). Sage Ved Vyas explains how the personal form of God is nirgu\u1e47a:yastu nirgu\u1e47a ityukta\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101stre\u1e63hu jagad\u012b\u015bhvara\u1e25pr\u0101k\u1e5bitairheya sanyuktairgu\u1e47airh\u012bnatvamuchyate (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47)[v3]\u201cWherever the scriptures refer to God as nirgu\u1e47a (without attributes), they mean that he is without material attributes. Nevertheless, his divine personality is not devoid of qualities\u2014he possesses infinite divine attributes.\u201dThis verse also reveals the proper object of meditation. Transcendental meditation does not mean to meditate upon nothingness. The entity transcendental to the three modes of material nature is God. And so, only when the object of our meditation is God can it truly be called transcendental meditation."

        "commentary": "The previous verse may give rise to the question about the relationship between Shree Krishna and the formless Brahman. It was previously stated that the all-powerful God has both aspects to his personality\u2014the formless and the personal form. Here, Shree Krishna reveals that the Brahman which the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs worship is the light from the personal form of God. Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:yannakhenduruchirbrahma dhyeya\u1e41 brahm\u0101dibhi\u1e25 surai\u1e25gu\u1e47atrayamat\u012bta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 vande v\u1e5bind\u0101vane\u015bhvaram(Patal Khand 77.60)[v4]\u201cThe light that emanates from the toe nails of the feet of the Lord of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna, is the transcendental Brahman that the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and even the celestial gods meditate upon.\u201d Similarly, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:t\u0101\u00f1h\u0101ra a\u1e45gera \u015bhuddha kira\u1e47a-ma\u1e47\u1e0dalaupani\u1e63hat kahe t\u0101\u00f1re brahma sunirmala(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela 2.12) [v5]\u201cThe effulgence emanating from the divine body of God is described by the Upani\u1e63hads as Brahman.\u201d Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna unequivocally confirms that the panacea for the disease of the three gu\u1e47as is to engage in unwavering devotion to the personal form of the Supreme Lord."

        "commentary": "Lord Shree Krishna speaks of the eternal A\u015bhvatth tree, which is an upside-down peepal (sacred fig) tree with its roots above and branches below. A\u015bhvatth also means; which will not remain the same even on the next day or something which is constantly changing. The Sanskrit word for the world, Sansar is defined in the Sanskrit dictionary as sansarat\u012bti sans\u0101ra\u1e25; something that is constantly shifting.\u00a0 Another Sanskrit word for the world Jagat is also defined as gachchhat\u012bti jagat, that means it is a constantly moving world. The world is not just moving or constantly changing, but someday it will be completely destroyed and reverted unto God. Therefore, the world we live in is temporary, or A\u015bhvatth.The Lord explains that this material world is like a huge A\u015bhvatth tree for the soul. Its roots are going upwards (\u016brdhva-m\u016blam) originating from God; nourished and supported by Him. The trunk and branches which are extending downwards (adha\u1e25-\u015bh\u0101kham) encompass all the life-forms from different abodes of the material realm. Its leaves are the Vedic mantras (chhand\u0101nsi), which describe rituals, ceremonies, and its reward. By performing such rituals, the soul can ascend to the heavenly abodes and enjoy celestial pleasures, but eventually, when the rewards deplete, they have to fall back to earth.In this way, the leaves of the A\u015bhvatth tree nourish the material existence of the souls and perpetuate the continuous cycle of life and death. Due to this continuity, the beginning and the end are not experienced by the souls. Hence, this tree form of the world is Avyayam or eternal. As the water from the oceans evaporates forming clouds that rain the earth, which then forms rivers, and eventually flows back to the oceans. Likewise, the cycle of life and death is also continuous.The Vedas also mention this tree:\u016brdhvam\u016blo \u2019v\u0101k\u015bh\u0101kha e\u1e63ho \u2019\u015bhvattha\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25 \u00a0 (Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had 2.3.1)\u00a0\u201cThe a\u015bhvatth tree, with its roots upward and branches downward is eternal.\u201d\u016brdhvam\u016bla\u1e41 arv\u0101k\u015bh\u0101kha\u1e41 v\u1e5bik\u1e63ha\u1e41 yo sampratina sa j\u0101tu jana\u1e25 \u015bhraddhay\u0101tm\u1e5bityutyurm\u0101 m\u0101rayaditi \u00a0 (Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yak 1.11.5)\u201cThose who know this tree with its roots upward and branches downward will not believe that death can finish them.\u201d\u00a0The intention of describing this tree in the Vedas was to make us understand that, we are beyond the cycle of life and death, and we should work towards cutting this tree down. For the same purpose, Lord Shree Krishna has mentioned that one who understands the secret (of cutting) this tree of samsara is the knower of the Vedas (veda vit)."

        "commentary": "Lord Krishna went on to explain how the human form is similar to the a\u015bhvatth tree. While in the human form the soul performs karmas, which is the trunk of the tree, and its branches (\u015bh\u0101kh\u0101s) extend both upward (\u016brddhva) and downward (adha\u1e25). Based on how the soul performed in its past and present forms it is reborn. If it led a virtuous life, when reborn, it moves to the upward branches which denote the celestial abodes of the gandharvas, devat\u0101s, etc. In case, a soul was involved in sinful acts, in the next birth, it gets degraded to the downwards branches, which are for the nether regions and animal species.Similar to how water irrigates a tree, the three modes of material nature or the three gunas irrigate this eternal tree of material existence. The sense objects generated by these gunas are like buds on the tree (vi\u1e63haya-prav\u0101l\u0101\u1e25), which sprout causing further growth.\u00a0 These buds sprout creating several aerial roots of material desires. For example, another tree of the fig family, the banyan tree has aerial roots which grow straight from the branches, down to the ground, and with the passage of time these turn into secondary trunks. This makes the banyan tree grow huge, covering a large area. \u201cThe Great Banyan\u201d in the Botanical Garden of Kolkata, is one of the largest known banyan trees. It is spread across a vast area of about 4.7 acres, with over 3700 aerial roots and crown circumference of about 486 meters.\u00a0Likewise, in the context of the material world, the sense objects are like the buds on the a\u015bhvatth tree, which sprout into aerial roots as they evoke desires of bodily pleasures in a person. To satiate these desires, a living being performs karma. But these desires are unending and keep increasing; similar to the aerial roots, which provide nourishment to this metaphorical tree, causing its unlimited expansion. Eventually, the soul gets further entangled into this web of material consciousness."

The buds of the tree, which are the objects of the senses lure them into developing desires. Ignorant souls keep working hard towards fulfilling these desires, which only keep increasing and nourish the tree to grow further. When such desires are fulfilled, they return with double the intensity forming greed. But when obstructed it causes anger, which fogs the intellect and further deepens the ignorance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the bodily form, the soul only thinks of itself to be the person in flesh and bones. It is forgetful of its origin and its eternal existence. It identifies itself with its human name, family, country, etc. Thus, to satisfy the bodily needs and in quest of material happiness, the living being gets involved in unfruitful endeavors. Sometimes to satiate one\u2019s materialistic desires knowingly or unknowingly a human being commits sins. These cause it to move downward and it is reborn in the lower species and nether regions. Whereas, sometimes it gets attracted towards the leaves of this tree, which are the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas, these help in accumulating pious merits. The propensity of material pleasures drives the human being to involve in such pious activities. The pious merits help the soul move upward in the celestial abodes, but once these merits deplete, it is sent back to the lower forms, and this cycle continues.\u00a0Thus, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a bhuli \u2019sei j\u012bva an\u0101di-bahirmukha, ataeva m\u0101y\u0101 t\u0101re deya sams\u0101ra-du\u1e25khakabhu swarge u\u1e6dh\u0101ya, kabhu narake \u1e0dub\u0101ya, da\u1e47\u1e0dya-jane r\u0101j\u0101 yena nad\u012bte chub\u0101y(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, Madhya Leela 20.117-118)\u201cSince the soul is forgetful of God since eternity, the material energy is subjecting it to worldly miseries.\u00a0 Sometimes, it lifts the soul to the celestial abodes, and other times it drops it down to the hellish regions.\u00a0 This is akin to the torture meted by kings in olden times.\u201d\u00a0 In the olden days, some kings ordered a very torturous punishment, wherein a person\u2019s head was immersed into the water almost till suffocation, then released for a few gasps, again put back into the water, and was repeated. The condition is similar for a soul trapped in the tree of material existence, it is pushed back and forth between the upper and lower regions according to its merits. When born in the celestial forms it enjoys some temporary relief, which fades soon and the soul gets dropped back to the human form.\u00a0\u00a0Several lifetimes have passed, and the soul continues to work towards material enjoyment. This has caused the tree to expand its roots of desire farther and has become huge. Yet, this tree can be cut with dispassion says, Lord Shree Krishna. The remedy for the soul\u2019s never-ending suffering is asa\u1e45g, which means detachment. The axe of detachment can cut the roots of desires which are nourished by the three modes of material nature. The Lord further explains that this axe of detachment can only be developed with the knowledge of the self. One has to realize that, \u201cI am not this material body, but an eternal spiritual being. The everlasting happiness that I pursue cannot be achieved with material things. My endeavors towards gratification of the material desires of this material body have no satiation, they are only getting me further trapped in the samsara or the web of life and death.\u201d\u00a0 With detachment, one can stop further growth of the tree roots, and due to lack of nourishment, the tree starts to wither.The next step is to look for the base of this upside-down tree, which in real terms is on the top and much higher than everything else. It\u2019s here that the Supreme Lord of all creation resides. As Lord Shree Krishna had earlier mentioned, \u201cI am the origin of all creation. Everything proceeds from Me. The wise who know this perfectly worship Me with great faith and devotion.\u201d\u00a0 (Verse 10.8) Therefore, to find the ultimate source, we must surrender to God as explained in this verse: \u201cI submit unto Him from whom the universe came into being a long time ago.\u201dThis way, the unfathomable tree can be conquered and axed. However, in an earlier verse Shree Krishna has also said that, \u201cMy divine energy, Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome.\u00a0 But those who surrender unto Me cross over it easily.\u201d (Verse 7.14) Therefore, the only way to cut down the a\u015bhvatth tree is by totally surrendering to the Supreme Lord and taking his refuge.

        "commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna has explained the requisites for complete surrender to the Supreme Lord, who is at the base of this enigmatic a\u015bhvatth tree. \u00a0The first step is to give up all pride, which is due to ignorance. The embodied souls have an illusion that they are the governors of all the material wealth that they have acquired, and continue accumulating more. Their minds are blinded by pride borne by ignorance, they think that all this is for their enjoyment, and would continue giving them happiness. A soul in such a state does not comprehend God as the owner of all. Thus, cannot surrender unto his will.Only through proper knowledge of God can this false notion of being the enjoyer be removed. It is necessary to realize that God alone is the owner of all the material energy and it needs to be used for his service only. He is the master of the entire creation, and the souls are his eternal servants. The souls should give up the attitude of pride and develop an attitude of selfless service to the Lord. This can be achieved by understanding the true nature of the self as the eternal servant, eliminating material attachments that pull us towards the world and away from him. The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:d\u0101sa bh\u016btamida\u1e41 tasya jagatsth\u0101vara jangamam\u015bhr\u012bmann\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a sw\u0101m\u012b jagat\u0101nprabhur\u012b\u015bhwara\u1e25\u201cThe Supreme Lord Narayan is the controller and the Lord of the world.\u00a0 All moving and non-moving beings and entities in this creation are His servants.\u201d\u00a0 Hence, as our desire to serve God increases, the illusion of being the enjoyer of prak\u1e5biti (material world) gets gradually eliminated and the heart is cleansed.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj emphasizes this above everything else, as the most powerful means for purifying the heart:sau b\u0101tana k\u012b b\u0101ta ika, dharu mural\u012bdhara dhy\u0101na,ba\u1e5bhavahu sev\u0101-v\u0101san\u0101, yaha sau j\u00f1\u0101nana j\u00f1\u0101na.(Bhakti \u015ahatak, verse 74)\u00a0\u201cOut of a hundred advice for purification, the most important is this.\u00a0 Let your mind be absorbed in the divine flute-player, Shree Krishna, and keep increasing your desire to serve Him.\u00a0 This counsel is more important than a hundred such gems of knowledge.\u201d\u00a0But what happens once our etheric hearts are cleansed and become perfectly situated in the loving service of the Lord? In this verse, Shree Krishna says that all those perfected souls enter his spiritual realm and stay there forever. Once the state of God-realization is achieved, the material realm serves no purpose, the soul is free from the cycle of life and death. It now stays in God\u2019s divine Abode along with other perfected, God-realized souls. The material realm is only one-fourth, while the spiritual realm is three-fourths of the entire creation. As a city prison only occupies a small part of a large city, similarly, the material realm is a very small part of God\u2019s vast creation. The Vedas state:p\u0101do \u2019sya vi\u015bhw\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni, trip\u0101dasya am\u1e5bitam divi\u00a0\u00a0 (Puru\u1e63h S\u016bktam Mantra 3)\u201cThis temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of creation.\u00a0 The other three parts are the eternal Abode of God that is beyond the phenomenon of life and death.\u201dIn the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the nature of the eternal Abode."

        "commentary": "Here, Lord Shree Krishna briefly describes his divine Abode, which he says is self-luminous. No sun, moon or fire is required to light it up. As the material realm is created by Maya (material energy), it is full of defects and dualities. Whereas, the divine realm is created by Yogmaya (spiritual energy), which is both transcendental and perfect. It is also described as sat-chit-\u0101nand\u00a0(full of bliss, knowledge, and eternality).The Paravyom is the spiritual sky of the divine realm. It is filled with splendor and divine opulence. It contains numerous abodes of various eternal forms of God. Narayan, Ram, Shree Krishna, etc. all have their separate Abodes.\u00a0 They reside there eternally along with their devotees and perform divine\u00a0Leelas (Pastimes). In a prayer to Shree Krishna Brahma says:goloka-n\u0101mni nija-dh\u0101mni tale cha tasyadev\u012b mahe\u015bha-hari-dh\u0101masu te\u1e63hu te\u1e63hute te prabh\u0101va-nichay\u0101 vihit\u0101\u015bh cha yenagovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi(Brahma Samhit\u0101 verse 43)\u201cIn the spiritual sky is Golok, the personal Abode of Shree Krishna.\u00a0 That spiritual sky also contains the Abodes of Narayan, Shiv, Durga, etc.\u00a0 I adore Supreme Divine Personality Lord Krishna, by the majesty of whose opulence, this is possible.\u201d Brahma has further described Golok in the following verse:\u0101nanda-chinmaya-rasa-pratibh\u0101vit\u0101bhist\u0101bhir ya eva nija-r\u016bpatay\u0101 kal\u0101bhi\u1e25goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016btogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi(Brahma Samhit\u0101 verse 37)\u201cI worship Govind, the Supreme Lord, who resides in Golok with the expansion of His own form, Radha.\u00a0 Their eternal Associates are the sakhis, who are enlivened by the ever-blissful spiritual energy and are the embodiments of sixty-four artistic abilities.\u201d\u00a0Shree Krishna assures Arjun that souls who attain him, reside eternally with him in His Supreme Abode, which is perfect in every way. These devotees become free from samsara the cycle of birth and death and get to participate in His Divine Leelas."

        "commentary": "In the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that all the perfected souls who find Him go to His Abode and never return to the material world. Now in this verse he says, but those who remain in the material world are also His An\u015bha or fragmental parts.Are the embodied souls also a part of God? To understand this, we must first look at what are the different forms in which God manifests. There are mainly two forms:Sw\u0101n\u015bh:\u00a0 All the direct forms of God, who are His integrated parts and not different from Lord Shree Krishna are called sw\u0101n\u015bh. They are also known as His Avatars such as Shree Ram, Narshingh Bhagavan, Varaha, Matsya, etc.Vibhinn\u0101n\u015bh:\u00a0 All the souls of existence come under this category; they are not directly His parts. These take form from His material energy or j\u012bva \u015bhakti. Shree Krishna had previously explained this in Verse 7.5 \u201cBut beyond the material energy, O mighty-armed Arjun, there is another superior energy of Mine.\u00a0 It is the embodied souls who are the basis of life in this world.\u201dThese vibhinn\u0101n\u015bh souls are further divided into three kinds:\u00a0Nitya Siddha:\u00a0 The liberated souls, who have always resided in the divine realm of God since eternity and participate in His divine Pastimes.S\u0101dhan Siddha:\u00a0 Those souls from the material world, who practiced s\u0101dhan\u0101 and attained the Supreme Lord.\u00a0 And now they reside in the divine realm for the rest of eternity.Nitya Baddha:\u00a0 The embodied souls who have been trapped in the material realm since eternity.\u00a0 Due to their material existence, these souls are dis-illusioned by their five senses and the mind. They are struggling in samsara; the cycle of birth and death.\u00a0The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had states:par\u0101\u00f1chi kh\u0101ni vyat\u1e5bi\u1e47at swayambh\u016b\u1e25 \u00a0\u00a0(2.1.1)\u201cThe creator, Brahma, has made the senses such that they are turned outward toward the world.\u201d\u00a0Therefore, Shree Krishna said for the vibhinn\u0101n\u015bh nitya baddha parts, \u201cBound by their material nature, these souls are struggling with the six senses including the mind.\u201d In the next verse, He explains when a soul moves from one body to another upon death, what happens to the mind and the senses."

        "commentary": "Here, Shree Krishna has given the example of the breeze to explain the process of transmigration of a soul from one body into another. Similar to the breeze, which carries with it the fragrances of the flowers, upon the death of the gross body, the soul carries with it the subtle and the causal bodies, these include the senses and the mind. (The concept of three kinds of bodies has been explained in detail in Verse 2.28).Even when the material body dies, the soul continues to carry the mind along with the experiences of its past lifetimes from its former body to the new one. That explicates why people who are born blind can still dream, probably based on their experiences from past lives. Dreams are considered to be a visual representation of what we see or think during waking hours. It might be in a distorted or rambled form, which gets connected in our mind when we sleep. For example, someone saw a bird flying and thought, \u201cHow wonderful will it be to fly like a bird!\u201d Sometime later, he dreams that he is flying in his human body itself. Yet, a blind person who has not seen anything from birth dreams, this can only be due to all the impressions that are stored in the subconscious mind, which it carries with it from past lifetimes.In the next verse, Shree Krishna explains what the soul does with the mind and senses it takes with it when it departs from its present body."

        "commentary": "The soul is divine, then how does it savor the objects of the senses? With the help of the mind and the senses, it can enjoy taste, smell, touch, feel or hear sounds. Even though the mind and senses are lifeless, due to the consciousness of the soul they become lifelike. This helps them to experience pleasure and pain from their thoughts, situations, persons, and objects of the senses. Then the embodied soul identifies the same experiences of the mind and the senses as its own because of the ego.The trouble here is, that the happiness experienced through the mind and the senses is material, but the soul is divine. Hence, regardless of the amount, the soul can never be satisfied with such material pleasures. It is restless and continuously keeps searching for that ultimate source of happiness.\u00a0Ralph Waldo Emerson an American philosopher very beautifully said, \u201cWe grant that human life is mean.\u00a0 But how did we find out that it is mean?\u00a0 What is the ground of this uneasiness, of this old discontent?\u00a0 What is this universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo by which the soul makes its enormous claim?\u201d Another famous philosopher, Meister Eckhart has written: \u201cThere is something in the soul which is above the living being, divine and simple. This light is only satisfied with the supra essential essence.\u201d\u00a0The divine bliss, which is both eternal and infinite; that the uncontended soul is continuously searching for; can only be attained from God. Those who realize that the mind and the senses are the cause of bondage, and the only way to break free is to turn these instruments of senses towards God, progresses on the path of devotion. Saint Tulsidas, the author of Ramayana in Hindi (Awadhi) is an excellent example.As a young lad, he was madly in love with his wife. Once she went for a few days to her parents\u2019 house, which was in a nearby village across a stream. At night, the weather was bad, but Tulsidas was very restless and eager to meet her. He decided to go and meet her right away. It was very dark and raining, so no boatman was willing to take him across the stream. Then he saw something floating nearby, thinking that it was a log, he clung to it and swam across.\u00a0 When he reached her house, it was late, he was hesitant to wake the entire household. His wife\u2019s room was on the second floor, he thought of calling out to her, but saw a rope hanging from her window. He caught that and went up to her room.She was astonished to see him there and enquired how he managed to come that late at night, in such terrible weather. He pointed at the window, but when they looked out of the window, both were shocked. There was no rope it was a snake, and what Tulsidas assumed to be a log, was in fact, a floating dead body. His desire for his wife was so intense that it had blinded his mind. She was furious and said to him, \u201cYou desire me, a body made of flesh and blood. If you would have such an intense desire for God, you would attain him and be free from the cycle of life and death.\u201dHer words had a life-changing effect on Tulsidas. He left home, renounced a householders\u2019 life and took up devotion. By detaching himself from the material pleasures and engaging them towards devotion to God, he went on to become a great saint and poet.\u00a0He later wrote:k\u0101mihi n\u0101ri pi\u0101ri jimi lobhihi priya jimi d\u0101ma,timi raghun\u0101tha nirantara priya l\u0101gahu mohi r\u0101ma(Ramayan)\u201cAs a lustful man desires a beautiful woman, and as an avaricious person desires wealth, may my mind and senses constantly desire Lord Ram.\u201d"

        "commentary": "The soul savors the perceptions of the mind and the senses while it resides within a body, but not everyone can understand this. It is a spiritual object and cannot be seen or touched using material senses. Several experiments have been conducted by scientists to find the soul, but the material instruments of the laboratories are no good to detect it. Hence, they conclude that all the bodily parts working together are the source of life.It is similar to a newbie mechanic trying to figure out how does a car move. He looks at the movement of the wheels, traces that back to the accelerator, then the steering wheel and the ignition switch. He concludes that all these parts make a car move. But he missed the important part, who starts the ignition and moves the steering wheel? Unless a driver operates the car, it would not move.\u00a0Similarly, devoid of spiritual knowledge about the existence of the soul and its functions, the physiologists\u2019 theory is that the physical body itself along with its different parts is the source of life.In this verse, Shree Krishna has said that the ignorant (vim\u016b\u1e0dh) are unaware of their own divine identity and presume the physical body to be the self.\u00a0 Only someone who has acquired spiritual knowledge understands that it is the soul that gives life to the body. Without the soul, the body is lifeless. When a person dies, the material parts of the body; the heart, brain, lungs, limbs, etc. are there, but they don\u2019t function, as the soul has left the body.Consciousness is an\u00a0indication of life or the presence of a\u00a0soul in a physical body. When the soul departs, consciousness ends. Only those who have acquired the eyes of knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na chak\u1e63hu) can understand this phenomenon."

        "commentary": "Only acquiring knowledge is not sufficient, it must also be in the proper direction. The common flaw with the human approach is that we tend to use our material senses to understand the divine. We want to decide the correctness and faults in knowledge with our intellect, which has only worldly but no experience of the divine. We believe that things which cannot be perceived by the mind and the senses do not exist.This approach is well elucidated by Noble laureate and French physiologist, Alexis Carrel. In his book, Man the Unknown, he states: \u201cOur mind has a natural tendency to reject the things that do not fit into the frame of scientific or philosophical beliefs of our time.\u00a0 After all, scientists are only human.\u00a0\u00a0 They are saturated with the prejudices of their environment and epoch.\u00a0 They willingly believe that facts which cannot be explained by current theories do not exist.\u00a0 At present times, scientists still look upon telepathy and other metaphysical phenomena as illusions.\u00a0 Evident facts having an unorthodox appearance are suppressed.\u201dAccording to Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan, one of the ancient schools of Hindu philosophy, such thinking is called k\u016bpa-ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka-ny\u0101ya (the logic of a well-frog).\u00a0 The story behind this is of a frog which has been living within the walls of a well, unaware of the world outside. Once an ocean frog gets washed off and falls into that well. The well-frog enquires to the newcomer, \u201cHow big is the ocean, where you lived?\u201d The ocean frog replied, \u201cIt is huge.\u201d The well-frog said, \u201cIt must be 5 times bigger than this well.\u201d To this, the ocean frog said, \u201cNo much bigger than that.\u201d The well-frog said, \u201cIs it 10 times bigger?\u201d \u201cMuch more than that,\u201d said the ocean frog. The well-frog was now curious and said, \u201cA hundred times?\u201d To this, the ocean frog replied, \u201cA hundred is nothing, the ocean is much bigger than that.\u201d The frog from the well did not believe the ocean frog and said, \u201cYou are a liar, how can any place be a hundred times bigger than my well?\u201d The well-frog had been living there its whole life, it had not seen anything beyond the walls of that well. Therefore, its mind could not comprehend the idea of a vast ocean, or the world that existed outside of that well.Like the frog of the well, materialistic people cannot perceive the idea of an eternal soul. Due to their limited experience and lack of spiritual knowledge, they cannot perceive that there is an entire spiritual universe beyond the understanding of their material intellects. Only those who have taken the path of spirituality, endeavor to purify their hearts with humility and faith. A cleansed mind naturally experiences the presence of the soul. Then the knowledge of the scriptures becomes clear to them.Similar to the existence of the soul, the senses cannot perceive the existence of God as well. Only through the eyes of knowledge can one realize God. In the next verse, Shree Krishna has briefed on the method of perceiving the existence of God."

        "commentary": "In the human form, we tend to forget our origin and eternal form. We regard ourselves as the physical body and get attracted to our bodily relations; parents, spouse, children, material wealth, etc. We feel they are the most significant. We also forget that it is God who is the creator and sustainer of the entire universe.In this verse, Lord Shree Krishna has said that the entire creation; is the manifestation of his energy. Even the Sun gets its radiance from him. According to scientific theories, the energy emitted\u00a0every second by the sun is equivalent to millions of nuclear power plants put together, and it\u00a0has been an uninterrupted process for billions of years. Yet this energy has not reduced in any way. The glory and brilliance of the sun are\u00a0a part of God\u2019s wonderful creation.Similarly, the night sky is lit\u00a0up by the moon. Though our mundane intellect might want us to believe and it is also scientifically concluded that moonshine is due to the reflection of the sun\u2019s light. But the periodic movement of the moon is also part of God\u2019s amazing creation. The sun, the moon, the planets, stars, the panch mahabhootas (earth, water, air, fire, and ether); in fact, the entire universe is a manifestation of God\u2019s vibh\u016btis (opulence). It would be very na\u00efve to think that such an amazing celestial arrangement is a result of some random big bang.There is a story in Kenopanishad, which explicates this. Once there was a prolonged war between the devat\u0101s (celestial gods) and the daityas (demons from the nether regions). Eventually, the devat\u0101s won by the grace of God. But their pride made them think that it was due to their own strength. God wanted to teach them a lesson; He manifested as an effulgent and powerful yak\u1e63ha (a semi-celestial being) in the celestial sky.When Indra, the King of Heaven saw this yak\u1e63ha, he felt insecure and intimidated. To find out who this yak\u1e63ha\u00a0was, he sent Agni, the fire god. With great pride,\u00a0Agni challenged the yak\u1e63ha and said, \u201cI am the fire god, and possess the power to burn the entire world within seconds, please reveal yourself.\u201d The yak\u1e63ha put in front of him a piece of straw and asked if he could burn it. Agni laughed, \u201cCan a blade of grass be a test for my immense power? Let that be.\u201d But when he moved forward to burn it, he could not and started feeling very cold himself. God had taken away his power, defeated and embarrassed he ran back to Indra.Next, Indra sent Vayu, the wind god to inquire who this yak\u1e63ha was. He went to the yak\u1e63ha and said, \u201cI am the wind god and possess the power to turn the world upside down within a few seconds, reveal who you are?\u201d Again, the yak\u1e63ha put a piece of straw in front of Vayu and said, \u201cTurn this over if you can?\u201d Vayu smirked with pride and tried to blow it, but could not. He felt powerless, and with great effort, he returned to Indra exhausted.Now Indra was raged and came to challenge the\u00a0yak\u1e63ha\u00a0himself. But by then the\u00a0yak\u1e63ha\u00a0had disappeared and in his place was seated Goddess Uma, God\u2019s divine\u00a0Yogmaya\u00a0power. A baffled Indra asked her, \u201cO Divine Mother, please tell me who was that powerful\u00a0yak\u1e63ha?\u201d She answered, \u201cO imprudent child, you could not recognize Him? Your pride had blinded your prudence. He was your Supreme Father, your creator, and power source, without him you would be powerless.\u201d Realizing his mistake, Indra begged for forgiveness."

God could have made the oceans full of freshwater, but it would have become a breeding ground for diseases. Due to the high salt content of the ocean water, many disease-causing microorganisms cannot survive in it, thereby protecting life.\u00a0Similarly, several such amazing phenomena make earth inhabitable to a variety of species, of both movable, and static living beings. Nobel laureate and famous American scientist, George Wald has written in his book, A Universe that Breeds Life: \u201cIf anyone of the considerable number of the physical properties of our universe were other than they are, then life, that now appears to be so prevalent, would be impossible, here or anywhere.\u201d\u00a0Shree Krishna also says that the moonlight gets its nourishing properties from Him.

This revelation by God suggests that such an approach is na\u00efve. It is God\u2019s energy which fires up the digestive process in living beings.Chaturvidham means four types and annam means food.

While the mind and the intellect are like software; the brain can be considered hardware. Yet this mechanism of the brain is way beyond human understanding.Although there is\u00a0vast development in technology, there are many areas where the scientific community is still struggling. For example, surgeons who perform brain transplant get delighted with their feat; but do not fully understand its functions. Another example is of face-recognition technology. It is remarkable\u00a0that humans can very easily recognize someone they meet after several years, even though there are many changes in their looks. Whereas,\u00a0present-day computers sometimes cannot even recognize\u00a0unchanged faces. How amazing it is that while the scanner software finds it difficult to read even typewritten text; humans can read even sketchy handwritings, without much effort. Such are the mysteries of the human brain which the Supreme Lord has created.\u00a0Shree Krishna says that He has also given us this power of forgetting the past. Similar to how unwanted records are deleted from a computer, living beings wipe off unwanted memories.

In this verse, the Lord has further revealed his glories in regards to the manifestation of the Vedas; that he is the creator, knower, and writer of the Vedas. God is divine and all his creations, including the Vedas, are divine. He alone is the knower of their true meaning; and only by his grace can a fortunate soul know the Vedas.\u00a0Ved Vyas\u00a0the author of the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan is considered to be an avatar of God. And Shree Krishna has specifically mentioned that he is the author of the Ved\u0101nt.\u00a0Eventually, He says\u00a0that although the Vedas give out numerous instructions both material and spiritual, the final objective of all knowledge is to know Him. The purpose of the rituals and ceremonies instructed are to lure people back from the material world towards spirituality. They act as an intermediate step to detach them from their materialistic mindset and direct them towards God.\u00a0The\u00a0Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had\u00a0(1.2.15) states:\u00a0sarve ved\u0101 yat padam\u0101mananti\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAll the Vedic mantras are actually pointing towards God.\u201d Memorizing and reciting the Vedic mantras in proper meter, following all the rituals, meditating or even awakening the\u00a0ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b\u00a0power; all will be worthless if we do not know God.

        "commentary": "In the previous verses, Shree Krishna spoke about the different worlds and categories of souls. Now he speaks of God - the Supreme Divine Personality called the Param\u0101tma, which means the Supreme Soul. The appellation of Param emphasizes on the fact that Param\u0101tm\u0101 is different from \u0101tm\u0101, which is an individual soul, whereas, Param\u0101tm\u0101 is the Supreme Soul. He is the transcendental God who controls both the perishable and imperishable worlds. For the non-dualistic philosophers who propagate that individual soul itself is the Supreme Soul, this verse is clear disapproval of their claim.\u00a0While the individual soul is very tiny and confined to the material body it resides in; the Supreme Soul is present inside every living entity. He is the constant companion of the individual soul in every life, immaterial of what species the soul gets born into. He sits in their hearts quietly taking a note; keeping an account of their karmas, and gives appropriate results.\u00a0 For example, in a particular birth, a soul has received a dog\u2019s body. The Supreme Soul continues to be inside and gives results based on the soul\u2019s past karmas. This explains why even dogs have different destinies. Some dogs are born on the streets, live a famished life, and die in misery. Whereas, some get to live comfortably as pets in lavish mansions, living a dainty life. This huge difference in destiny is due to the stockpile of karmas from their previous births. The Supreme Soul which accompanies the soul in its various births, in different species, keeps granting results based on its karmas.The Supreme Soul also exists in a personal form as the four-armed Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, commonly known as \u201cBhagwan Vishnu\u201d. A popular saying in Hindi goes: \u201cm\u0101rane v\u0101le ke do h\u0101th, bach\u0101ne v\u0101le ke ch\u0101r h\u0101th\u201d which means, a killer has two arms, but the savior has four arms.\u00a0 The four-armed personality referred to here is the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Soul."

        "commentary": "So far in this chapter, Shree Krishna has detailed that His opulence is the source of all the magnificence in nature, and in creating the visible universe he does not deplete Himself. In this verse, He has called Himself\u00a0Puru\u1e63hottam, the Divine Supreme Person who transcends over the material world, which includes both\u00a0k\u1e63har the\u00a0perishable and\u00a0ak\u1e63har\u00a0the imperishable divine souls.\u00a0 \u00a0Does that mean the\u00a0Puru\u1e63hottam\u00a0He has referred to and Lord Shree Krishna Himself are two different entities? To eliminate any such doubts, in this verse, while referring to Himself Shree Krishna has used the term\u00a0aham\u00a0(I), which is first person singular. He also said that the Vedas and the Smritis have described Him similarly:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a eva paro devas ta\u1e41 dhy\u0101yet ta\u1e41 rasayet ta\u1e41 yajet ta\u1e41 bhajed(Gop\u0101l T\u0101pani Upani\u1e63had)\u201cLord Krishna is the Supreme Lord. Meditate upon Him, relish the bliss of His devotion, worship Him, and serve Him.\u201d\u00a0yo \u2019sau para\u1e41 brahma gop\u0101la\u1e25(Gop\u0101l T\u0101pani Upani\u1e63had)\u00a0\u201cGopal (Lord Krishna) is the Supreme Being.\u201dThen the question arises, who are Lord Ram, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, and all the other Gods and Goddesses? They are all different manifestations of the same\u00a0Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Divine Personality and should not be considered separate."

        "commentary": "As per the Shreemad Bhagavatam, there are three ways to realize God:vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayambrahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015bhabdyate\u00a0 \u00a0(1.2.11)\u201cThe knowers of the Truth have stated that there is only one Supreme Entity that manifests in three ways in the world\u2014Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d\u00a0This does not mean that these three are different entities, God is one, and these forms are only his manifestations. \u00a0As water exists in nature as ice, water, and steam that have different physical properties; but are forms of the same substance; likewise, God exists in three forms Brahman, the formless, omnipotent and omnipresent. The followers of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga worship God as Brahman. The a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yoga seeks God as Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Soul who resides in the hearts of all living creatures. Whereas, Bhagav\u0101n is more personal and can be considered the sweetest among his form. Here, God manifests as a person and performs sweet Leelas (pastimes). The devotees of the Bh\u0101kti-yoga savor this form and immerse themselves in his loving bliss, as explained earlier in verse 12.2.In this chapter, Shree Krishna has described all three forms of God. But which of them is the most complete? Here, in this verse lies the answer. Shree Krishna says those who know Him as the Supreme Divine Personality and worship him as Bhagav\u0101n truly have complete knowledge of Him.Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj in his book Bhakti \u015ahatak has given a detailed explanation of why Bhagav\u0101n realization is the highest. He has quoted the same verse 1.2.11 of the Shreemad Bhagavatam and said:t\u012bna r\u016bp \u015bhr\u012b k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a ko, vedavy\u0101s bat\u0101ya,brahma aura param\u0101tm\u0101, aru bhagav\u0101n kah\u0101ya.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 21)\u201cVed Vyas has declared that the Supreme Lord manifests in three ways\u2014Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d\u00a0 Then he goes on to describe these three manifestations of the Absolute Truth.sarva\u015bhakti sampann ho, \u015bhakti vik\u0101sa na hoya,sat\u00a0chit\u00a0\u0101nanda r\u016bp jo, brahma kah\u0101ve soya.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 22)\u201cAs Brahman, the infinite energies of God are all latent.\u00a0 He merely displays eternal knowledge and bliss.\u201dsarva\u015bhakti sanyukta ho, n\u0101ma r\u016bp gu\u1e47a hoya,l\u012bl\u0101 parikara rahit ho, param\u0101tm\u0101 hai soya.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 23)\u00a0\u201cAs Param\u0101tm\u0101, God displays His Form, Name, and Virtues.\u00a0 But He does not engage in Leelas, nor does He have associates.\u201dsarva\u015bhakti pr\u0101ka\u1e6dya ho, l\u012bl\u0101 vividha prak\u0101ra,viharata parikara sang jo, tehi bhagav\u0101n puk\u0101ra.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 24)\u201cThe aspect of God in which He manifests all His energies and engages in various loving Pastimes with His devotees is called Bhagav\u0101n.\u201dThrough these verses, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has explicated that; while in His manifestation as Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 God does not reveal himself completely; but as Bhagav\u0101n, He manifests himself with all his Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates.\u00a0 This complete realization of the Supreme Entity has also been explained earlier in verse 12.2, with the example of a train. Thus, those who seek God as Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Divine Personality can truly acquire complete knowledge of Him."

This is to imply that, \u201cArjun, here I have given you the gist of all the hidden knowledge of the Vedic Scriptures. From the description of the nature of this\u00a0world to the differentiation between matter and spirit. Finally, the realization of the Absolute Truth\u00a0about Oneself and the Supreme Divine Personality, God. I assure you that\u00a0whoever espouses this knowledge will be truly enlightened.

        "commentary": "Here, Shree Krishna describes twenty-six virtues of a saintly nature. These should be cultivated as a part of our spiritual practice for elevating ourselves to the supreme goal.Fearlessness. It is the state of freedom from concern for present and future miseries. Inordinate attachment of any kind causes fear. Attachment to wealth leads to dread of impoverishment, attachment to social prestige causes fear of infamy, attachment to vice leads to anxiety about the consequences of sin, attachment to bodily comfort causes the fear of ill-health, and so on. Detachment and surrender to God vanquish all fear from the heart.Purity of mind. This is the state of inner cleanliness. The mind generates and harbors thoughts, sentiments, feelings, emotions, etc. When these are ethical, wholesome, positive, and uplifting, the mind is considered pure, and when they are unethical and degrading, the mind is considered impure. Attachment to objects in the modes of passion and ignorance contaminate the mind, while attachment to God purifies it.Steadfastness in spiritual knowledge. It is said: tattva vismara\u1e47\u0101t bhekivat [v1] \u201cWhen human beings forget what is right and what is wrong they become like animals.\u201d Thus, the path of virtue is forged by remaining steadfast in the awareness of spiritual principles.Charity. It refers to the giving away of one\u2019s possessions for a good cause or to needy persons. True charity is that which is done, not with a feeling of superiority, but with a sense of gratefulness to God for the opportunity to help. Material charity, done for the welfare of the body, helps others temporarily. Spiritual charity, done at the platform of the soul, helps eliminate the cause of all suffering, which is separation from God. Consequently, it is considered higher than material charity.Control of the senses. The senses are notorious in their ability to drag the mind deeper into material illusion. They tempt the living being to seek immediate gratification. However, walking the path of virtue requires forsaking the lower sensual pleasures for achieving the higher goal. Thus, restraint of the senses is an essential virtue for treading the path to God.Sacrifice. It means executing one\u2019s Vedic duties and social obligations, even though they may not be enjoyable. Sacrifice is considered perfect when it is done for the pleasure of God.Study of the sacred books. An important aspect of cultivating the divine nature is to feed the intellect with uplifting knowledge from the scriptures. When the intellect is illumined with proper knowledge, one\u2019s actions naturally become sublime.Austerity. The body-mind-senses are such that, if we pamper them, they become pleasure-seeking, but if we restrain them, they become disciplined. Thus, austerity is the voluntary acceptance of hardships for purifying the body, mind, and intellect.Straightforwardness. Simplicity in speech and conduct unclutters the mind and engenders the sprouting of noble thoughts. The English phrase \u201csimple living, high thinking\u201d aptly expresses the benefits of the virtue of straightforwardness.Non-violence. It means not impeding the progressive life of other living beings through thought, word, or deed.Truthfulness. It means restraining oneself from distorting facts to suit one\u2019s purpose. God is the Absolute Truth, and hence the practice of truthfulness takes us toward him; on the other hand, falsehood, while convenient, takes us away from God.Absence of anger. The manifestation of anger is a defect of the material mind. It takes place when the desires for happiness are obstructed and things do not turn out how one envisaged. By developing detachment and surrender to the will of God, one overcomes anger.Renunciation. The entire material energy belongs to God and it is meant for his pleasure. Hence, the opulences of the world are not for one\u2019s enjoyment, but for being utilized in the service of God. To be fixed in this understanding is renunciation.Peacefulness. The cultivation of virtue requires mental poise. Peacefulness is the ability to retain inner equilibrium despite disturbing external situations.Restraint from fault-finding. The whole world and everything in it is a mixture of good and bad qualities. Focusing upon defects in others dirties our mind, while focusing upon their virtues purifies it. The nature of a saintly person is to see his or her own defects and observe the virtues of others.Compassion toward all living beings. As individuals evolve spiritually, they naturally rise above self-centeredness and develop empathy for all living beings. Compassion is the deep sympathy that arises upon seeing the sufferings of others.Absence of covetousness. Greed is the desire to accumulate more than what one legitimately needs for the maintenance of the body. Under its sway, people acquire huge amounts of wealth and possessions, though they know, that at the time of death, everything will be left behind. Freedom from such covetousness leads to contentment and inner peace.Gentleness. The disposition of behaving roughly with others arises from insensitivity to their feelings. But as one grows in spiritual stature, one naturally sheds crudeness in behavior. Gentleness is a sign of spiritual refinement.Modesty. Hr\u012b\u1e25 means \u201csense of guilt in performing actions contrary to the injunctions of scriptures and society.\u201d The saintly nature is imbued with a ruthless inner conscience that gives one a sense of guilt in committing sinful acts.Lack of fickleness. We may begin with good intentions, but if we get distracted by temptations and hardships, we cannot complete the journey. Success on the path of virtue comes by unwaveringly pursuing the goal despite all diversions that come on the way.Vigor. From purity of mind comes a deep inner drive to act according to one\u2019s values and beliefs. Hence, saintly personalities bring immense power and vigor to the tasks they pursue.Forgiveness or forbearance. This is the ability to tolerate the offences of others, without feeling the need to retaliate. Through forgiveness, one heals the emotional wounds caused by others that would otherwise fester and disturb the mind.Fortitude. It is the inner strength and determination in pursuing the goal, even when the mind and senses are wearied due to unfavorable circumstances. Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all. Sri Aurobindo put this very eloquently: \u201cYou have to be more persistent than the difficulty; there is no other way.\u201dCleanliness. It refers to both internal and external purity. Virtuous people believe in maintaining external cleanliness because it is conducive to internal purity. George Bernard Shaw said, \u201cBetter keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world.\u201dBearing enmity toward none. Bearing enmity toward others poisons our own mind, and this becomes an impediment in the path of spiritual progress. The quality of freedom from hatred toward others is developed by realizing that they are also like us, and God resides in all.Absence of vanity. Self-praise, boastfulness, ostentation, etc. all stem from pride. Saintly personalities see nothing in themselves to be proud about, but instead, feel gratitude to God for the good qualities they possess. Thus, they refrain from self-aggrandizement."

They are hypocrites, meaning they make an external show of virtuous behavior for impressing others, without possessing the matching internal traits. This creates an artificial Jekyll and Hyde personality, which is impure internally but has the external appearance of being pure.\nThe behavior of demoniac natured people is arrogant and disrespectful to others. They are proud and conceited about their bodily possessions and designations, such as wealth, education, beauty, position, etc. They become angry when, due to lack of control of the mind, their lust and greed are frustrated. They are cruel and harsh, and devoid of sensitivity for others\u2019 sufferings in their interactions with them. They have no understanding of the spiritual principles and hold unrighteousness to be righteousness."

        "commentary": "Having described the two kinds of natures, Shree Krishna now declares the consequences of both. He says that the demoniac qualities keep one fettered to the samsara of life and death, while the cultivation of saintly virtues helps one break through the bondage of Maya.\nTo tread the spiritual path successfully and pursue it till the end, a s\u0101dhak (aspirant) needs to watch out for many things. If even one of the demoniac qualities, such as arrogance, hypocrisy, etc. remains in the personality, it can become the cause of failure. Simultaneously, the divine virtues need to be developed, for without the saintly qualities, our spiritual progress can again become crippled. For example, without fortitude, we will give up the journey when the going becomes difficult; without forgiveness, the mind will be tied down to hatred and not have the ability to be absorbed in God. But if we possess the saintly virtues that Shree Krishna mentions, then our ability to progress rapidly and cope with the obstacles on the path increases. Thus, developing good qualities and eliminating the bad ones is an integral part of spiritual practice. A useful technique that helps us work on removing our weaknesses and developing virtues is the maintenance of a personal diary. Many successful persons kept memoirs and diaries to help them develop the virtues they felt were necessary for success. Mahatma Gandhi and Benjamin Franklin both mention having used such techniques in their autobiographies.\nSome may argue that if we develop devotion to God, we will naturally, over time, acquire the saintly virtues described by Shree Krishna. That is indeed true, but it is unlikely that we will start out on the path full of devotion from the outset itself, free all the negative traits, any one of which can dramatically interfere with devotional progress. Most people need to slowly develop bhakti through practice, and success in practice will come by possessing saintly qualities and eliminating demoniac ones. Hence, as a part of our efforts in devotion, we must also keep working on ourselves to develop the divine qualities that Shree Krishna has mentioned in this chapter and shed any demoniac ones."

        "commentary": "All souls carry their natures with them from past lives. Accordingly, those cultivated virtuous qualities and performed meritorious deeds in the past lives are the ones who are born with divine natures, while those who indulged in sin and defiled their minds in previous lives carry the same tendencies into the present one. This explains the varieties of natures of living beings in the world. The divine and demoniac natures are the two extremes of this spectrum.\nThe living beings in the celestial abodes possess more virtuous qualities, while the demoniac traits dominate in the lower abodes. Humans possess a mixture of both divine and demoniac traits. Even in the cruelest butcher, we sometimes find the quality of kindness existing in personal life. And even in elevated spiritual aspirants we find defects of virtue. It is said that in Satya-yug, the gods and demons lived on different planets (i.e., separate planes of existence); in Tret\u0101-yug, they resided on the same planet; during Dw\u0101par-yug, they lived in the same family; and in Kali-yug, the godly and demoniac natures coexist in the same person\u2019s heart. That is the dilemma of human existence, where the higher self pulls it upward toward God, while the lower self pulls it downward. Having described the saintly qualities, Shree Krishna now goes into an extended description of the lower nature, to help us recognize it and avoid it."

        "commentary": "Dharma consists of codes of conduct that are conducive to one\u2019s purification and the general welfare of all living beings. Adharma consists of prohibited actions that lead to degradation and cause harm to society. The demoniac nature is devoid of faith in the knowledge and wisdom of the scriptures. Hence, those under its sway are confused about what is right and wrong action.A typical example of this is the present trend in western philosophy. Having evolved through various schools of thought after the Renaissance, such as Age of Enlightenment, Humanism, Empiricism, Communism, Existentialism, and Skepticism, the present era in western philosophy is labeled as \u201cPost-modernism.\u201d The prevalent view of Post-modernist thought is that there is no absolute truth. Multitudes have rejected the possibility that such a thing as absolute truth could exist. \u201cAll is relative\u201d has become the slogan of the post-modernist era of philosophy. We often hear phrases like \u201cthat may be true for you, but it\u2019s not true for me.\u201d Truth is seen as a personal preference or perception that cannot extend beyond a person\u2019s individual boundaries. This viewpoint has a big bearing on the subject of ethics, which deals with the question of right and wrong behavior. If there is no such thing as absolute truth, then there is no ultimate moral rightness or wrongness about anything. Then, people are justified in saying, \u201cIt may be right for you but that does not mean it is right for me.\u201dSuch an idea is very appealing to many, but if taken to its logical extreme it proves absurd and disastrous. For example, what if it is right for someone to ignore traffic lights, even when they are red? That person will put the life of others at risk by doing what he believes is right. What if it is considered right by someone to go on a suicide-bombing mission in a heavily populated civilian area amongst people he sees as enemies? He may be fully convinced that what he is doing is correct. But does that make it right in any sense of the word? If there is no such thing as absolute truth, then no-one can really say \u201che should do that\u201d or \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d All one can say is, \u201cA lot of people do not feel good about this action.\u201d According to the relativist viewpoint, one might respond, \u201cThat may be true for you, but it is certainly not true for us.\u201d These can be the ruinous ethical consequences of disregarding the belief of an Absolute Truth.Shree Krishna states that the demoniac nature is confused about what is right and what is wrong, and thus, neither purity, nor truth, nor right conduct is found in them. In the following verse, he goes on to describe the predominant views of such people."

        "commentary": "There are two ways of refraining from immoral behavior. The first is to refrain from unrighteousness through the exercise of will-power. The second way is to abstain from sin due to fear of God. People who have the ability to abstain from sinning merely by will-power are very few. The majority of people desist from doing wrong due to the fear of punishment. For example, it is observed on highways that the moment a police car is spotted, people immediately slow down to the permissible speed limit, but when they perceive there is no danger of being caught, they do not hesitate in exceeding the speed limit. Thus, if we believe in God, out of fear of him we will refrain from immoral behavior. Instead, if we do not believe in God, all his laws will still be applicable to us, and we will suffer the consequences of wrong-behavior.Those with demoniac natures do not wish to accept this imposition of authority and regulation of behavior that is a necessary corollary of belief in God. Instead, they prefer to subscribe to the view that there is no God and the world has no basis for moral order. They propagate ideas such as the \u201cBig Bang Theory,\u201d which postulates that the world was created by an accidental explosion that took place at time zero of creation, and thus there is no God who sustains the world. Such theories permit them to engage in sensual gratification without scruples or fear of consequences.Amongst the various forms of sensual gratification, sexual indulgence is the most intense. This is because the material realm is like a distorted reflection of the spiritual realm. In the spiritual realm, divine love is the basis of the activities of the liberated souls and their interactions with God. In the material realm, its distorted reflection, lust, dominates the consciousness of materially conditioned souls, particularly those under the mode of passion. Thus, the demoniac-minded see engagement in lustful activities as the purpose of human life."

He said:\ny\u0101vajj\u012bveta suka\u1e41 j\u012bvet, \u1e5bi\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u1e5bitv\u0101 gh\u1e5bita\u1e41 pivet\nbhasm\u012b bh\u016btasya dehasya punar\u0101gamana\u1e41 kuta\u1e25 [v2]\n\u201cAs long as you live, enjoy yourself. If drinking ghee gives you pleasure, then do so even if you have to take a debt for the purpose. When the body is cremated, you will cease to exist, and will not come back in the world again (so do not worry of any karmic consequences of your actions).\u201d\nIn this fashion, the demoniac-minded reject the eternality of the soul and the possibility of karmic reactions, so that they may engage in self-serving and even cruel deeds without any qualms. If they happen to possess power over other humans, they impose their misleading materialistic views upon them as well. They do not hesitate to aggressively pursue their self-centered goals, even if it results in grief to others and destruction to the world. In history, humankind has repeatedly witnessed megalomaniac dictators and emperors, such as Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, etc. who were motivated by their perverse views of the truth and brought about untold suffering and devastation to the world."

They prefer to pursue the way of the world that promises to provide immediate gratification, but they end up struggling even more in the worldly direction. Their desires for material attainments torment them and they undertake enormous schemes to fulfill their aspirations. When a cherished object is attained, for a moment they experience relief, but then new anguish begins. They are worried about the object being snatched away and they labor to retain it. Finally, when the inevitable separation from the object of attachment takes place, there is only misery.

They become practically possessed by their own mind, which goes on and on like a broken record, and they live in the reality their thoughts create for them. One such favorite thought pattern of the impure mind is complaining. It loves to whine and feel resentful not only about people but also about situations. The implication is, \u201cThis should not be happening,\u201d \u201cI do not want to be here,\u201d \u201cI am being treated unfairly,\u201d etc. Every complaint is a little story that the mind makes up and the individual completely believes in it. The voice in the head tells sad, anxious, or angry stories about one\u2019s life. And the poor individual, under the sway of the ego, accepts what the voice says. When complaining aggravates, it turns into resentment. Resentment means feeling bitter, indignant, aggrieved, or offended. When the resentment becomes longstanding, it is called a grievance. A grievance is a strong negative emotion connected to an event in the past that is being kept alive by compulsive thinking, by retelling the story in the head of \u201cwhat someone did to me.\u201d In this verse, Shree Krishna says that the demoniac who choose to live in the mesh of delusion created by the ego become bewildered by numerous thoughts of the poorest quality.

The results are bestowed by God in accordance with the law of karma. The Ramayan states:\nkarama pradh\u0101na bisva kari r\u0101kh\u0101, jo jasa karai so tasa phala ch\u0101kh\u0101 [v9] \n\u201cActions are important in this world. Whatever actions people perform, they taste the corresponding fruits.\u201d Hence, everyone has to face the karmic consequences of their actions. The Bible also states: \u201cBe sure your sin will find you out.\u201d (Numbers 32.23)[v9.1] Thus, in their next lives, God casts those who choose to cultivate demoniac qualities into inferior states of existence. The principle is very simple:\n\u016brdhva\u1e41 gachchhanti sattvasth\u0101 madhye ti\u1e63h\u1e6dhanti r\u0101jas\u0101\u1e25\njaghanya gu\u1e47a v\u1e5bittisth\u0101 adho ti\u1e63h\u1e6dhanti t\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25 (Garu\u1e0d Pur\u0101\u1e47)[v10]\n\u201cThose who act out of s\u0101ttvic mentalities rise to the higher levels of existence; those who act out of r\u0101jasic mentalities remain in the middle regions; and those who act out of a t\u0101masic mentality and are inclined toward sin descend to the lower levels of existence.\u201d"

Previously, in verse 3.36, Arjun had asked him why people are impelled to commit sin, even unwillingly, as if by force. Shree Krishna had answered that it is lust, which later transforms into anger, and is the all-devouring enemy of the world. Greed is also a transformation of lust, as explained in detail in the commentary of verse 2.62. Together, lust, anger, and greed are the foundations from which the demoniac vices develop. They fester in the mind and make it a suitable ground for all other vices to take root. Consequently, Shree Krishna labels them as gateways to hell, and strongly advices to shun them to avoid self-destruction. Those desirous of welfare should learn to dread these three and carefully avoid their presence in their own personality."

But the ways of the demoniac are the reverse of the teachings of the scriptures. They engage in prohibited acts and refrain from recommended ones.

By comparing and differentiating between the divine and demoniac natures, he highlighted how the demoniac nature leads to hellish existence. Thus, he established that nothing is to be gained by discarding the injunctions of the scriptures. Now he drives home the point by stating that the absolute authority in ascertaining the propriety of any activity, or lack of it, are the Vedic scriptures.\nSometimes, even well-intentioned people say, \u201cI do not care for rules. I follow my heart and do my own thing.\u201d It is all very well to follow the heart, but how can they be sure that their heart is not misleading them? As the saying goes, \u201cThe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d Thus, it is always wise to check with the scriptures whether our heart is truly guiding us in the proper direction. The Manu Sm\u1e5biti states:\nbh\u016bta\u1e41 bhavya\u1e41 bhavi\u1e63hya\u1e41 cha sarva\u1e41 ved\u0101t prasidhyati (12.97)[v12]\n\u201cThe authenticity of any spiritual principle of the past, present, or future, must be established on the basis of the Vedas.\u201d Hence, Shree Krishna concludes by instructing Arjun to comprehend the teachings of the scriptures and act according to them."

Their faith is reposed elsewhere. It could be on the logical ability of their intellect, or the perceptions of their senses, or the theories they have decided to believe in. For example, when people say, \u201cI do not believe in God because I cannot see him,\u201d they do not have faith in God but they have faith in their eyes. Hence, they assume that if their eyes cannot see something, it probably does not exist. This is also a kind of faith. Others say, \u201cI do not believe in the authenticity of the ancient scriptures. Instead I accept the theories of modern science.\u201d This is also a kind of faith, for we have seen in the last few centuries how theories of science keep getting amended and overthrown. It is possible that the present scientific theories we believe to be true may also be proved incorrect in the future. Accepting them as truths is also a leap of faith. Prof. Charles H. Townes, Nobel Prize winner in Physics, expressed this very nicely: \u201cScience itself requires faith. We don\u2019t know if our logic is correct. I don\u2019t know if you are there. You don\u2019t know if I am here. We may just be imagining all this. I have a faith that the world is what it seems like, and thus I believe you are there. I can\u2019t prove it from any fundamental point of view\u2026 Yet I have to accept a certain framework in which to operate. The idea that \u2018religion is faith\u2019 and \u2018science is knowledge,\u2019 I think, is quite wrong. We scientists believe in the existence of the external world and the validity of our own logic. We feel quite comfortable about it. Nevertheless these are acts of faith. We can\u2019t prove them.\u201d Whether one is a material scientist, a social scientist, or a spiritual scientist, one cannot avoid the leap of faith required in the acceptance of knowledge. Shree Krishna now explains the reason why different people choose to place their faith in different places."

Where we decide to place our faith and what we choose to believe in practically shapes the direction of our life. Those who develop the conviction that money is of paramount importance in the world spend their entire life accumulating it. Those who believe that fame counts more than anything else dedicate their time and energy in chasing political posts and social designations. Those who believe in noble values sacrifice everything to uphold them. Mahatma Gandhi had faith in the incomparable importance of satya (truth) and ahins\u0101 (non-violence), and by the strength of his convictions he launched a non-violent movement that succeeded in evicting from India the most powerful empire in the world. Those who develop deep faith in the overriding importance of God-realization renounce their material life in search of him. Thus, Shree Krishna states that the quality of our faith decides the direction of our life. In turn, the quality of our faith is decided by the nature of our mind. And so, in response to Arjun\u2019s question, Shree Krishna begins expounding on the kinds of faith that exist."

Foods that are impure, have bad taste, or possess foul smells come in the same category. Impure foods also include all kinds of meat products. Nature has designed the human body to be vegetarian. Human beings do not have long canine teeth as carnivorous animals do, or a wide jaw suitable for tearing flesh. Carnivores have short bowels to allow minimal transit time for the unstable and dead animal food, which putrefies and decays faster. On the contrary, humans have a longer digestive tract for the slow and better absorption of plant food. The stomach of carnivores is more acidic than human beings, which enables them to digest raw meat. Interestingly, the carnivorous animals do not sweat through their pores. Rather, they regulate body temperature through their tongue. On the other hand, herbivorous animals and humans control bodily temperature by sweating through their skin. While drinking, carnivores lap up water rather than suck it. In contrast, herbivores do not lap up water; they suck it. Humans too suck water while drinking; they do not lap it up. All these physical characteristics of the human body reveal that God has not created us as carnivorous creatures, and consequently, meat is considered impure food for humans.Meat-eating also creates bad karma.

Shree Krishna had stated in verse 6.5, \u201cElevate yourself through the power of your mind and not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self.\u201dThe mind may be likened to a garden, which can either be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild. Gardeners cultivate their plot, growing fruits, flowers, and vegetables in it. At the same time, they also ensure that it remains free from weeds. Similarly, we must cultivate our own mind with rich and noble thoughts, while weeding out the negative and debilitating thoughts. If we allow resentful, hateful, blaming, unforgiving, critical, and condemning thoughts to reside in our mind, they will have a debilitating effect on our personality. We can never get a fair amount of constructive action out of the mind until we have learned to control it and keep it from becoming stimulated by anger, hatred, dislike, etc. These are the weeds that choke out the manifestation of divine grace within our hearts.People imagine that their thoughts are secret and have no external consequences because they dwell within the mind, away from the sight of others. They do not realize that thoughts not only forge their inner character but also their external personality. That is why we look upon someone and say, \u201cHe seems like a very simple and trustworthy person.\u201d For another person, we say, \u201cShe seems to be very cunning and deceitful. Stay away from her.\u201d In each case, it was the thoughts people harbored that sculpted their appearance. Ralph Waldo Emerson said: \u201cThere is full confession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations, in the grasp of the hands. Our sin bedaubs us, mars all the good impressions. Men do not know why they do not trust us. The vice glasses the eyes, demeans the cheek, pinches the nose, and writes, \u2018O fool, fool!\u2019 on the forehead of a king.\u201d Another powerful saying linking thoughts to character states:\u201cWatch your thoughts, for they become words.Watch your words, for they become actions.Watch your actions, for they become habits.Watch your habits, for they become character.Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.\u201dIt is important to realize that we harm ourselves with every negative thought that we harbor in our mind. At the same time, we uplift ourselves with every positive thought that we dwell upon. Henry Van Dyke expressed this very vividly, in his poem \u201cThoughts are things.\u201dI hold it true that thoughts are things;They\u2019re endowed with bodies and breath and wingsThat which we call our secret thoughtSpeeds forth to earth\u2019s remotest spot,Leaving its blessings or its woes,Like tracks behind as it goes.We build our future, thought by thought.For good or ill, yet know it not,Choose, then, thy destiny and wait,For love brings love, and hate brings hate.Each thought we dwell upon has consequences, and thought-by-thought, we forge our destiny. For this reason, to veer the mind from negative emotions and make it dwell upon the positive sentiments is considered austerity of the mind."

It reduces the attachment of the giver toward material objects; it develops the attitude of service; it expands the heart, and fosters the sentiment of compassion for others. Hence, most religious traditions follow the injunction of giving away one-tenth of one\u2019s earnings in charity. The Skandh Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:ny\u0101yop\u0101rjita vittasya da\u015bham\u0101n\u015bhena dh\u012bmata\u1e25kartavyo viniyoga\u015bhcha \u012b\u015bhvaraprityarthameva cha [v7]\u201cFrom the wealth you have earned by rightful means, take out one-tenth, and as a matter of duty, give it away in charity. Dedicate your charity for the pleasure of God.\u201d Charity is classified as proper or improper, superior or inferior, according to the factors mentioned by Shree Krishna in this verse. When it is offered freely from the heart to worthy recipients, at the proper time, and at the appropriate place, it is bequeathed to be in the mode of goodness."

Amongst these three modes, the mode of ignorance degrades the soul into nescience, languor, and sloth. The mode of passion excites the living being and binds it in innumerable desires. The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating, and engenders the development of virtues. Yet, the mode of goodness is also within the realm of Maya. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use the mode of goodness as a stepping-stone to reach the transcendental platform. In this verse, Shree Krishna goes beyond the three gu\u1e47as, and discusses the words Om Tat Sat, which symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth.

Doubt is also like an untamed horse that runs wild in the mind and destroys the garden of devotion. Arjun indicates, \u201cJust as you slayed the Keshi demon, please slay the demon of doubt in my mind.\u201d His question is penetrating and poignant. He wishes to know the nature of sany\u0101s, which means \u201crenunciation of actions.\u201d He also wishes to know the nature of ty\u0101g, which means \u201crenunciation of desires for enjoying the fruits of actions.\u201d Further, he uses the word p\u1e5bithak, meaning difference; he wishes to understand the distinction between the two terms. Arjun also refers to Shree Krishna as Hrishikesh, meaning \u201cmaster of the senses.\u201d Arjun\u2019s goal is to accomplish the greatest of conquests, which is to subdue the mind and the senses. It is this conquest that can bestow the state of perfect peace. And the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, as the Master of the senses, himself embodies this state of perfection.This topic had been explained in the previous chapters as well. Shree Krishna had talked about sany\u0101s in verses 5.13 and 9.28, and about ty\u0101g in verses 4.20 and 12.11, but he explains it here from another angle. The same truth permits itself to be presented from a variety of perspectives and each perspective provides its own unique appeal. For example, various sections of a garden leave differing impressions on the viewer\u2019s mind, while the entire garden creates yet another impression. The Bhagavad Gita is very much like this. Each chapter is designated as a particular Yog, while the eighteenth chapter is considered the synopsis. In this chapter, Shree Krishna briefly summarizes the perennial principles and eternal truths that were presented in the previous seventeen chapters and establishes the collective conclusion of all of them. After discussing the topics of renunciation and detachment, he goes on to explain the natures of the three gu\u1e47as and how they affect people\u2019s natural propensities for work. He reiterates that the mode of goodness is the only mode worthy of cultivation. He then concludes that bhakti, or exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord is the paramount duty, and its attainment is the goal of human life."

Those who renounce works for material enjoyment and enter the renounced order are called karm sany\u0101s\u012bs. They continue to do some of the nitya karm (daily works for the maintenance of the body), but they renounce k\u0101mya karm (works related to acquisition of wealth, progeny, prestige, status, power, etc). Such works bind the soul further in the wheel of karma and lead to repeated rebirths in the samsara of birth and death.\nVichak\u1e63ha\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 are the wise. Shree Krishna states that wise people lay emphasis on ty\u0101g, meaning \u201cinternal renunciation.\u201d This implies not relinquishing the prescribed Vedic duties, rather renouncing the desires for enjoying their fruits. Therefore, the attitude of giving up attachment to the rewards of actions is ty\u0101g, while the attitude of giving up works is sanyas. Both sany\u0101s and ty\u0101g seem plausible and reasonable options to pursue for enlightenment. Of these two courses of action, which one does Shree Krishna recommend? He provides more clarity on this topic in the subsequent verses."

They opine that all actions should be abandoned because they are motivated by desire, which promotes further transmigration in the cycle of life and death. They contend that all works are subject to inherent defects, such as indirect violence. For example, if one lights a fire, there is always the possibility of insects getting involuntarily burnt in it. Hence, they recommend the path of cessation of all actions, except those for the sustenance of the body.\nOther learned philosophers, such as those of the M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 school of thought, declare that prescribed Vedic activities should never be given up. They contend that wherever there are two contradictory injunctions of the Vedas, if a specific one is more prominent, it annuls the general one. For example, the Vedas instruct us: m\u0101 hinsy\u0101t sarv\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni [v1] \u201cDo not commit violence toward any living entity.\u201d This is a general instruction. The same Vedas also instruct us to perform fire sacrifice. This is a specific instruction. It is possible that in performing a fire sacrifice some creatures may get killed in the fire unintentionally. But the M\u012bm\u0101nsakas (followers of the M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 philosophy) contend that the specific instruction for performing the sacrifice prevails, and it must be followed even though it conflicts with the general instruction for not committing violence. Therefore, the Mim\u0101nsakas say we must never give up beneficial activities, such as sacrifice, charity, and penance."

Such actions, if performed in the proper consciousness, do not bind us, instead they help us grow spiritually. Consider, for example, a caterpillar. In order to transform itself, it weaves a cocoon for its evolution and encages itself in it. Once it becomes a butterfly, it breaks open the cocoon and soars into the sky. Our position in the world is similar to this. Like the ugly caterpillar, we are presently attached to the world and bereft of noble qualities. As a part of our self-preparation and self-education, we need to perform actions that bring about the inner transformation we desire. Yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), d\u0101n (charity), and tapa (penance) are acts that help in our spiritual evolution and growth. At times, it may seem that they are binding too, but they are like the caterpillar\u2019s cocoon.

Fulfilling them helps develop many qualities in an individual, such as responsibility, discipline of the mind and senses, tolerance of pain and hardships, etc. Abandoning them, out of ignorance, leads to the degradation of the soul. These obligatory duties vary according to one\u2019s level of consciousness.

Advanced s\u0101dhaks are not those who are undisturbed because they do nothing, on the contrary, they retain their peace despite upholding a huge burden placed upon their shoulders. Shree Krishna declares in this verse that giving up duties because they are troublesome is renunciation in the mode of passion.\nFrom the beginning, the Bhagavad Gita is a call for action. Arjun finds his duty unpleasant and bothersome and, as a result, wishes to run away from the battlefield. Shree Krishna calls this ignorance and weakness. He encourages Arjun to continue doing his duty, even though it may be unpleasant, while simultaneously bringing about an internal transformation within him. For this purpose, he enlightens Arjun with spiritual knowledge and helps him develop the eyes of wisdom. Having heard the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun does not change his profession, but changes the consciousness he brings to bear upon his activities. Previously, the motive behind his work was to secure the kingdom of Hastinapur for his comfort and glory. Later, he continues to do his work, but as an act of devotion to God."

He describes this as the highest kind of renunciation, which is situated in the mode of goodness (s\u0101ttvic).Renunciation is definitely necessary for spiritual attainment. But the problem is that people\u2019s understanding of renunciation is very shallow and they consider it to be only the external abandonment of works. Such renunciation leads to hypocrisy in which, while externally donning the robes of a renunciant, one internally contemplates upon the objects of the senses. There are many sadhus in India who come in this category. They left the world with the noble intention of God-realization, but because the mind was not yet detached from the objects of their senses, their renunciation did not bestow the desired fruits. Consequently, they found their actions did not lead them to a higher spiritual life at all. The defect was in their sequence\u2014they strove first for external renunciation and later for internal detachment. The instruction of this verse is to reverse the sequence\u2014first develop internal detachment and then renounce externally."

        "commentary": "It may be contended that better than renunciation of the fruits of actions is to simply renounce all actions, for then there will be no distraction from meditation and contemplation. Shree Krishna rejects this as a possible option by stating that the state of complete inactivity is impossible for the embodied being. The basic functions for the maintenance of the body, such as, eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. have to be performed by everyone. Besides, standing, sitting, thinking, walking, talking, etc. are also activities that cannot be avoided. If we understand renunciation to be the external abandonment of works, then no one can ever be truly renounced. However, Shree Krishna states here that if one can give up attachment to the fruits of actions, it is considered perfect renunciation."

        "commentary": "The three kinds of rewards that the soul reaps after death are: 1) i\u1e63h\u1e6dam, or pleasant experiences in the celestial abodes, 2) ani\u1e63h\u1e6dam, or unpleasant experiences in the hellish abodes, and 3) mi\u015bhram, or mixed experiences in the human form on the earth planet. Those who perform virtuous actions are awarded the celestial realms; those who perform unrighteous actions are given birth in the nether realms; and those who perform a mixture of both come back to the human realm. But this applies only when the actions are performed with a desire for rewards. When such fruitive desire is renounced and work is done merely as a duty to God, then no such results accrue from actions.A similar rule exists in the world as well. If one person kills another it is considered murder, which is a crime that can even result in the death sentence. However, if the government declares that someone is a notorious murderer or thief who is wanted dead or alive, then killing such a person is not considered an offence in the eyes of the law. Instead, it is rewarded by the government, and the killer is even respected as a national hero. Similarly, when we give up personal motive in our actions, then the three-fold fruits of actions do not accrue."

Simultaneously, he clarifies that the description of the five limbs of action is not a new analysis, but what has previously been described in the S\u0101nkhya philosophy as well. S\u0101nkhya refers to the system of philosophy established by Maharishi Kapil, who was a descension of God and appeared on the earth as the child of Kardam Muni and Devahuti. The S\u0101nkhya philosophy he propounded is based upon a system of analytical rationality. It develops knowledge of the self through an analysis of the elements within the body and in the world. It also ascertains the nature of cause and effect by an analysis of the elements of action."

        "commentary": "In this verse, adhi\u1e63h\u1e6dh\u0101nam means \u201cplace of residence,\u201d and refers to the body, since karmas can only be performed when the soul is situated in the body. Kart\u0101 means \u201cthe doer,\u201d and refers to the soul. Although the soul itself does not perform actions, it inspires the body-mind-intellect mechanism with the life force to act. Further, it identifies with their actions, due to the influence of the ego. Therefore, it is responsible for the actions performed by the body, and it is called both the knower and the doer. The Pra\u015bhna Upani\u1e63had states: e\u1e63ha hi dra\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101 spra\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101 \u015bhrot\u0101 ghr\u0101t\u0101 rasayit\u0101 mant\u0101 boddh\u0101 kart\u0101 vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101tm\u0101 puru\u1e63ha\u1e25 sa pare \u2019k\u1e63hara \u0101tmani sa\u1e41prati\u1e63h\u1e6dhate (4.9)[v3] \u201cIt is the soul that sees, touches, hears, feels, tastes, thinks, and comprehends. Thus, the soul is to be considered both\u2014the knower and the doer of actions.\u201d The Brahma S\u016btra also states: j\u00f1o \u2018ta eva (2.3.18)[v4] \u201cIt is truly the soul that is the knower.\u201d Again, the Brahma S\u016btra states: kart\u0101 \u015bh\u0101str\u0101rthavattv\u0101t (2.3.33)[v5] \u201cThe soul is the doer of actions, and this is confirmed by the scriptures.\u201d From the above quotations, it is clear that the soul is also a factor in accomplishing actions.The senses are instruments used for performing actions. Without the senses, the soul could not have experienced the sensations of taste, touch, sight, smell, or sound. There are also the five working senses\u2014hands, legs, voice, genitals, and anus. It is with their help that the soul accomplishes various kinds of work. Thus, the senses are also listed as factors in accomplishing actions.Despite all the instruments of action, if one does not put in effort, nothing is ever done. In fact, effort is so important that Chanakya Pandit states in his Neeti S\u016btras: uts\u0101havat\u0101\u1e41 \u015bhatravopi va\u015bh\u012bbhavanti [v6] \u201cWith sufficient effort, even poor destiny can be transformed into good fortune.\u201d Nirutv\u0101h\u0101d daiva\u1e41 patita [v7] \u201cWithout proper effort, even good destiny can be converted into misfortune.\u201d Therefore, che\u1e63h\u1e6dh\u0101 (effort) is another ingredient of action.God is seated within the body of the living being as the witness. Based upon their past karmas, he also bestows different abilities to different people to perform actions. One may call this Divine Providence. For example, some people possess the acumen for earning huge amounts of wealth. Their acquaintances become astonished by their brilliant financial analysis of complex situations. They also seem to be lucky with the risks they take. This special intellect is granted to them by God. Similarly, others seem to have God-given talents in fields such as sports, music, art, literature, etc. It is God who bestows people these special abilities, in accordance with their past karmas. He also grants the results of the present karmas. Hence, he is listed as one of the factors responsible for action."

        "commentary": "Having described the obtuse intellect in the previous verse, Shree Krishna now describes the pure intellect. He says that those with purified intellect are free from the false pride of being the doer. They also do not seek to enjoy the fruits of their actions. Thus, they are not bound in the karmic reactions of what they do. Previously in verse 5.10 as well, he had stated that those who are detached from results are never tainted by sin. From a material perspective, they may appear to be working, but from a spiritual perspective, they are free from selfish motivations, and therefore they do not become bound by the results of karma.Rahim Khankhana was a famous poet saint, during the Mughal period in Indian history. Although a Muslim by birth, he was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. When he would give alms in charity, he would lower his eyes. A sweet incident is related about this habit of his. It is said that Saint Tulsidas heard of Rahim\u2019s style of giving alms, and asked him:ais\u012b den\u012b dena jyu\u00f1, kita s\u012bkhe ho sainajyo\u1e45 jyo\u1e45 kara \u016b\u00f1chyo karo, tyo\u1e45 tyo\u1e45 niche naina [v13]\u201cSir, where did you learn to give alms like this?

        "commentary": "In his systematic treatment of the science of action, Shree Krishna explained its limbs. He also explained the karmic reactions of actions, and the process of becoming free from them. Now, he discusses the three-fold factors that propel actions. These are j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge), j\u00f1eya (the object of knowledge), and j\u00f1\u0101t\u0101 (the knower). Together, the three are called the j\u00f1\u0101na tripu\u1e6d\u012b (triad of knowledge).\n\u201cKnowledge\u201d is a primary impetus for action; it provides understanding to the \u201cknower\u201d about the \u201cobject of knowledge.\u201d This triad jointly induces action. For example, knowledge of the remuneration to be paid by the employer motivates employees to work; information of the discovery of gold in various parts of the world led to gold rushes involving feverish migration by workers; awareness of the importance of winning a medal in the Olympics motivates sportspersons to practice for years. Knowledge also has a correlation to the quality of work. For instance, a degree from a top college carries weight in the job market. Corporations realize that people with higher quality knowledge can perform work more proficiently. That\u2019s why good corporations invest in the development of their people, such as sponsoring employees for developmental seminars to further advance their skill set.\nThe second set named is the karm tripu\u1e6d\u012b (triad of action). It includes the kart\u0101 (doer), k\u0101ra\u1e47 (the instrument of action), and karm (the act itself). This triad of work jointly constitutes the content of action. The \u201cdoer\u201d utilizes the \u201cinstruments of action\u201d to perform \u201cthe action.\u201d Having analyzed the constituents of action, Shree Krishna now relates them to the three modes of material nature, to explain why people differ from each other in their motives and actions."

Then in chapter 17, he went into great detail about how these three modes influence the kinds of faith people develop and also their choice of foods. He also explained the three categories of sacrifice, charity, and penance. Here, according to the three gu\u1e47as, the Lord will explain the three types of knowledge, action, and doers.\nAmongst the six systems of thought in Indian philosophy, the S\u0101nkhya philosophy (also called puru\u1e63h prak\u1e5biti v\u0101da) is recognized as the authority in the matter of analysis of material nature. It considers the soul as the puru\u1e63h (lord), and thus recognizes many puru\u1e63has. Prak\u1e5biti is the material nature and includes all things made from it. S\u0101nkhya states the cause for misery is the desire of the puru\u1e63h to enjoy prak\u1e5biti. When this enjoying propensity subsides, then the puru\u1e63h is released from the bondage of material nature attains eternal beatitude. The S\u0101nkhya system does not acknowledge the existence of the Param Puru\u1e63h, or the Supreme Lord, and hence it is insufficient for knowing the Absolute Truth. However, in the matter of knowledge about prak\u1e5biti (material nature), Shree Krishna refers to it as the authority."

Those who possess this vision of knowledge see the unity that exists behind the variety of creation, just as an electrical engineer sees the same electricity flowing through different gadgets, and a goldsmith sees the same gold cast into different ornaments. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam (1.2.11)[v15]\u201cKnowers of the truth have stated that there is only one entity in existence, without a second.\u201d Chaitanya Mahaprabhu referred to God, in his form as Shree Krishna, as advaya j\u00f1\u0101na tattva [v16] (one without a second, the only thing and everything that exists in creation), on the basis of the following four criteria:1. Saj\u0101t\u012bya bhed \u015bh\u016bnya. (He is one with all similar entities.) Shree Krishna is one with the various other forms of God, such as Ram, Shiv, Vishnu, etc. since these are different manifestations of the one God.Shree Krishna is also one with the souls, who are his tiny fragmental parts. A fragment is one with its whole, just as flames are one with the fire of which they are tiny parts.2. Vij\u0101t\u012bya bhed \u015bh\u016bnya. (He is one with all dissimilar entities.) Dissimilar to God is Maya, which is insentient, while God is sentient. However, Maya is an energy of God, and energy is one with its energetic, just as the energies of fire\u2014heat and light\u2014are non-different from it.3. Swagat bhed \u015bh\u016bnya. (The various parts of his body are non-different from him.) The amazing thing about God\u2019s body is that all the parts perform the functions of all the other parts. The Brahma Samhit\u0101 states:a\u1e45g\u0101ni yasya sakalendriya-v\u1e5bitti-manti pa\u015bhyanti p\u0101nti kalayanti chira\u1e41 jaganti (5.32)[v17]\u201cWith every limb of his body, God can see, hear, talk, smell, eat, and think.\u201d Hence, all the limbs of God\u2019s body are non-different from him.4. Swayam siddha. (He needs the support of no other entity.) Maya and the soul are both dependent upon God for their existence. If he did not energize them, they would cease to exist. On the other hand, God is supremely independent and does not need the support of any other entity for his existence.The Supreme Lord Shree Krishna satisfies all the four above points, and thus he is the advaya j\u00f1\u0101na tattva, in other words, he is everything that exists in creation. With this understanding, when we see the entire creation in its unity with God, it is considered s\u0101ttvic knowledge.

        "commentary": "Having explained the three kinds of knowledge, Shree Krishna now describes the three kinds of action. In the passage of history, many social scientists and philosophers have given their opinion regarding what is proper action. A few of the important ones and their philosophies are mentioned here.1. The Epicureans of Greece (third century BC) believed that to \u201ceat, drink, and be merry\u201d was right action.2. More refined was the philosophy of Hobbs of England (1588 \u2013 1679) and Helvetius of France (1715 \u2013 1771). They said that if everyone becomes selfish and does not think of others, there will be chaos in the world. So they recommended that along with personal sense gratification we should also care for others. For example, if the husband is sick, the wife should take care of him; and if the wife is sick, the husband should take care of her. In the case where helping others conflicts with the self-interest, they advised that self-interest should be given the priority.3. Joseph Butler\u2019s (1692 \u2013 1752) philosophy went beyond this. He said that the idea of service to others after catering to our own self-interest was wrong. Helping others is a natural human virtue. Even a lioness feeds her cubs while remaining hungry herself. So, service to others must always take priority. However, Butler\u2019s concept of service was limited to the alleviation of material suffering; for example, if a person is hungry, he should be fed. But this does not really solve problems because after six hours the person is hungry again.4. After Butler came Jeremy Bentham (1748 \u2013 1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806 \u2013 1873). They recommended the utilitarian principle of doing what is best for the majority. They suggested following the majority opinion for determining proper behavior. But if the majority is wrong or misguided then this philosophy falls through, for even a thousand ignorant people together cannot match the quality of thought of one learned person.Other philosophers recommended following the dictates of the conscience. They suggested that it is the best guide in determining proper behavior. However, the problem is that everyone\u2019s conscience guides differently. Even in one family, two children have different moral values and conscience. Besides, even one person\u2019s conscience changes over time. If a murderer is asked whether he feels bad on killing people, he replies, \u201cInitially I would feel bad, but later it became as trivial as killing mosquitoes. I feel no remorse.\u201dRegarding proper action, the Mahabharat states:\u0101tmana\u1e25 pratik\u016bl\u0101ni pare\u015bh\u0101\u1e41 na sam\u0101charet\u015bhruti\u1e25 sm\u1e5biti\u1e25 sad\u0101ch\u0101ra\u1e25 svasya cha priyam\u0101tmana\u1e25 (5.15.17)[v18]\u201cIf you do not like it when others behave with you in a certain way, then do not behave with them in that way either. But always verify that your behavior is in accordance with the scriptures.\u201d Conduct yourself with others as you desire them to behave with you. The Bible also says, \u201cDo to others as you would have them do to you.\u201d (Luke 6.31)[v19] Here, Shree Krishna declares, in a similar way that action in the mode of goodness is doing one\u2019s duty in accordance with the scriptures. He further adds that such work should be without attachment or aversion, and without desire to enjoy the results."

So, action in the mode of passion is motivated by huge ambition and characterized by intense effort. It entails heavy toil and great physical and mental fatigue. An example of r\u0101jasic action is the corporate world. Management executives regularly complain of stress. This is because their actions are usually motivated by pride and an inordinate ambition for power, prestige, and wealth. The efforts of political leaders, over-anxious parents, and business persons are also often typical examples of actions in the mode of passion."

Having described the categories of two of them\u2014knowledge and actions\u2014he now moves on to the three kinds of performers of actions. He clarifies that those situated in the mode of goodness are not inactive; rather they work with enthusiasm and determination. The difference is that their work is performed in proper consciousness. S\u0101ttvic doers are mukta sanga\u1e25, i.e. they do not try to cling to things in worldly attachment, nor do they believe that worldly things can bestow satisfaction to the soul. Hence, they work with noble motives. And since their intentions are pure, they are filled with uts\u0101ha (zeal) and dh\u1e5biti (strong resolve) in their endeavors. Their mental attitude results in the least dissipation of energies while working. Thus, they are able to work tirelessly to fulfill their sublime motives. Though they may accomplish great things, they are anaham v\u0101d\u012b (free from egotism), and they give all credit for their successes to God."

While the s\u0101ttvic workers are motivated by the desire for spiritual growth, the r\u0101jasic workers are deeply ambitious for materialistic enhancement. They do not realize that everything here is temporary and will have to be left behind one day. Agitated with immoderate r\u0101g (desires of the mind and senses), they do not possess the purity of intention. They are convinced that the pleasure they seek is available in the things of the world. Hence, never satisfied by what comes their way, they are lubdha\u1e25 (greedy for more). When they see others succeeding or enjoying more than them, they become hins\u0101tmaka\u1e25 (enviously bent on injury). To fulfill their ends, they sometimes sacrifice morality, and hence become a\u015bhuchi\u1e25 (impure). When their desires are fulfilled they become elated, and when they are daunted they get dejected. In this way, their lives become har\u1e63ha \u015bhoka anvita\u1e25 (a mixture of delights and sorrows)."

Buddhi is the faculty of discrimination that distinguishes between right and wrong.

Robert Frost vividly describes this in his poem, The Road Not Taken:I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.To make proper choices, a developed faculty of discrimination is required. The Bhagavad Gita itself was spoken to Arjun to equip him with the power of discrimination. At the outset, Arjun was confused about his duty. His inordinate attachment to his relatives had bewildered his judgment regarding proper and improper action. Feeling weak and fearful, and in utter confusion, he had surrendered to the Lord and requested him to enlighten him regarding his duty. Through the divine song of wisdom, Lord Krishna helped Arjun develop his power of discrimination, until he finally concluded: \u201cI have explained to you the knowledge that is more secret than all secrets. Ponder over it deeply, and then do as you wish.\u201d (verse 18.63)The mode of goodness illumines the intellect with the light of knowledge thereby refining its ability to discriminate the right and wrong of things, actions, and sentiments. The s\u0101ttvic intellect is one that makes known to us what type of action is to be performed and what type of action is to be renounced, what is to be feared and what is to be ignored. It explains to us the reason for the shortcomings in our personality and reveals the solution for them."

But children dislike it, since it has a bitter taste. Parents in North India encourage children to eat it, saying: \u0101mle k\u0101 kh\u0101y\u0101 aur ba\u1e0do\u1e45 k\u0101 kah\u0101, b\u0101d me\u1e45 pat\u0101 chalat\u0101 hai [v20.1] \u201cThe benefits of both these\u2014eating of \u0101ml\u0101 and the advice of the elders\u2014are experienced in the future.\u201d Interestingly, after eating the \u0101ml\u0101, in just a couple of minutes, the bitter taste disappears and sweetness is experienced. And the long-term benefits of consuming the natural Vitamin C are undoubtedly numerous. In the above verse, Shree Krishna says that happiness in the mode of goodness is of the same nature; it seems bitter in the short-run, but it tastes like nectar in the end.The Vedas refer to happiness in the mode of goodness as \u015bhreya, which is unpleasant in the present but ultimately beneficial.

Hence all living beings in these abodes, be they humans or the celestial gods, are under the sway of these three modes. The difference is only in the relative proportions of the three gu\u1e47as.

        "commentary": "Someone said very appropriately that to find the perfect profession is like finding a perfect life-partner. But how do we discover the perfect profession for ourselves? Here, Shree Krishna explains that people have different natures, according to the gu\u1e47as that constitute their personality, and thus different professional duties are suitable for them. The system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram dharma was a scientific organization of society according to svabh\u0101va-prabhavair gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 (work based on one\u2019s nature and gu\u1e47as). In this system of categorization, there were four \u0101\u015bhrams (stages in life) and four var\u1e47as (occupational categories). The stages in life were: 1) Brahmacharya \u0101\u015bhram (student life), which lasted from birth till the age of 25. 2) G\u1e5bihastha \u0101\u015bhram (household life), which was regular married life, from the age of 25 till 50. 3) V\u0101naprastha \u0101\u015bhram (semi-renounced life), which was from the age of 50 till 75. In this stage, one continued to live with the family but practiced renunciation. 4) Sany\u0101s \u0101\u015bhram (renounced order), which was from the age of 75 onward, where one gave up all household duties and resided in a holy place, absorbing the mind in God.\nThe four var\u1e47as (occupational categories) were Brahmin (priestly class), Kshatriya (warrior and administrative class), Vaishya (mercantile and farming class), and Shudra (worker class). The var\u1e47as were not considered higher or lower amongst themselves. Since the center of society was God, everyone worked according to their intrinsic qualities to sustain themselves and society, and make their life a success by progressing toward God-realization. Thus, in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system, there was unity in diversity. Diversity is inherent in nature and can never be removed. We have various limbs in our body, and they all perform different functions. Expecting all limbs to perform the same functions is futile. Seeing them all as different is not a sign of ignorance, but factual knowledge of their utilities. Similarly, the variety amidst human beings cannot be ignored. Even in communist countries where equality is the foremost principle, there are party leaders who formulate ideologies; there is the military that wields guns and protects the nation; there are farmers who cultivate the land; and there are industrial workers who do mechanical jobs. The four classes of occupations exist there as well, despite all attempts to equalize. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system recognized the diversity in human natures and scientifically prescribed duties and occupations matching people\u2019s natures.\nHowever, with the passage of time the var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system deteriorated, and the basis of the var\u1e47as changed from one\u2019s nature to one\u2019s birth. The children of Brahmins started calling themselves as Brahmins, irrespective of whether they possessed the corresponding qualities or not. Also, the concept of upper and lower castes got propagated and the upper castes began looking down upon the lower castes. When the system grew rigid and birth-based, it became dysfunctional. This was a social defect that crept in with time, and was not the original intention of the Var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system. In the next few verses, according to the original categorization of the system, Shree Krishna maps the gu\u1e47as of people with their natural qualities of work."

Therefore, if we can simply perform our swa-dharma in accordance with our nature and position in life, we will participate in his divine plan for our purification. When done in devotional consciousness our work itself becomes a form of worship.\nA powerful story illustrating that no duty is ugly or impure, and it is only the consciousness with which we do it that determines its worth, was told to Yudhishthir by Sage Markandeya, in the Vana Parva of the Mahabharat. The story goes that a young sany\u0101s\u012b went into the forest, where he meditated and performed austerities for a long time. A few years went by, and one day a crow\u2019s droppings fell upon him from the tree above. He looked angrily at the bird, and it fell dead on the ground. The sany\u0101s\u012b realized he had developed mystical powers as a result of his austerities. He became filled with pride. Shortly thereafter, he went to a house to beg for alms. The housewife came to the door, and requested him to wait a while, since she was nursing her sick husband. This angered the monk and he glanced angrily at her, thinking, \u201cYou wretched woman, how dare you make me wait! You do not know my powers.\u201d Reading his mind, the woman replied, \u201cDo not look at me with such anger. I am not a crow to be burnt by your glance.\u201d The monk was shocked, and asked how she knew about the incident? The housewife said she did not practice any austerities, but did her duties with devotion and dedication. By virtue of it, she had been illumined and was able to read his mind. She then asked him to meet a righteous butcher who lived in the town of Mithila, and said that he would answer his questions on dharma. The sany\u0101s\u012b overcame his initial hesitation of speaking to a lowly butcher, and went to Mithila. The righteous butcher then explained to him that we all have our respective swa-dharma, based upon our past karmas and competence. But if we discharge our natural duty, renouncing the desire for personal gain and rising above the fleeting happiness and misery coming our way, we will purify ourselves and graduate to the next class of dharma. In this manner, by doing the prescribed duties and not running away from them, the soul gradually evolves from its present gross consciousness to divine consciousness. The lecture the butcher delivered is known as the Vyadha Gita of the Mahabharat.\nThis message is particularly applicable to Arjun because he wanted to run away from his dharma, thinking it is painful and miserable. In this verse, Shree Krishna instructs him that by doing his prescribed duty in proper consciousness he will be worshipping the Supreme, and will easily attain perfection."

Events drove him to a situation where it was necessary to participate in a war of righteousness. If he were to shirk from his duty and withdraw from the battlefield to practice austerities in the forest, it would not help him spiritually, for even in the forest, he would not be able to get away from his inherent nature. In all likelihood, he would gather the tribal people in the jungle and become their king. Instead, it would be better for him to continue doing his duty born of his nature, and worship God by offering the fruits of his works to him.\nWhen one becomes spiritually accomplished the swa-dharma changes. It no longer remains at the bodily platform; it becomes the dharma of the soul, which is devotion to God. At that stage, one is justified in giving up occupational duties and engaging wholeheartedly in devotion because that is now the swa-dharma of one\u2019s nature. For people with that eligibility, Shree Krishna will give the final conclusion in the end of the Bhagavad Gita: \u201cGive up all varieties of dharmas and simply surrender unto me.\u201d (18.66) However, until that stage is reached, the instruction given in this verse applies. Thus, the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:\nt\u0101vat karm\u0101\u1e47i kurv\u012bta na nirvidyeta y\u0101vat\u0101\nmat-kath\u0101-\u015bhrava\u1e47\u0101dau v\u0101 \u015bhraddh\u0101 y\u0101van na j\u0101yate (11.20.9)[v23]\n\u201cWe must keep doing our prescribed occupational duties as long as the taste for devotion through hearing, chanting, and meditating on the leelas of God has not developed.\u201d"

        "commentary": "People sometimes recoil from their duty because they see a defect in it. Here, Shree Krishna states that no work is free from defect, just as fire naturally has smoke on top of it. For example, we cannot breathe without killing millions of microbes. If we cultivate the land, we destroy innumerable microorganisms. If we succeed against competition in business, we deprive others of wealth. When we eat, we deprive another of food. Since swa-dharma entails activity, it cannot be devoid of defects.\nBut the benefits of the swa-dharma far outweigh its defects. And the foremost benefit is that it provides a comfortable and natural path for one\u2019s purification and elevation. In his book, Making a Life, Making a Living, Mark Albion, who was a professor at the Harvard Business School, cites a study in which the careers of 1,500 business school graduates were tracked from 1960 to 1980. From the beginning, graduates were grouped in two categories. In category A were those who said they wanted to make money first, so that they could do what they really wanted to do later, after they had taken care of their financial concerns. Eighty-three percent fell in category A. In category B were those who pursued their interests first, sure that money would eventually follow. Seventeen percent came in category B. After 20 years, there were 101 millionaires. One person was from category A (who wanted to make money first), and one hundred from category B (who pursued their interest first). The overwhelming majority of the people who became wealthy did so thanks to the work they found profoundly absorbing. Mark Albion concludes that for most people there is a difference between work and play. But if they do what they love, then work becomes play, and they never have to work for another day in their life. That is what Shree Krishna is asking Arjun to do\u2014not to abandon the work that is best suited to his nature, even if it has defects in it, rather to work according to his natural propensity. But for work to be elevating, it must be done in the proper consciousness, described in the next verse."

        "commentary": "In this last chapter, Shree Krishna repeats many of the principles he has already explained. In the beginning of this chapter, he explained to Arjun that merely running away from the responsibilities of life is not sany\u0101s, nor is it renunciation. Now he describes the state of actionlessness, or nai\u1e63hkarmya-siddhi. This state can be reached even amidst the flow of the world by detaching ourselves from events and outcomes, and simply focusing on doing our duty. This is just as water flowing under a bridge enters from one side and flows out from the other. The bridge is neither the recipient of the water nor its distributor; it remains unaffected by its flow. Likewise, the karm yogis do their duty, but keep the mind unaffected by the stream of events. They do not neglect putting in their best efforts in doing their duty, as an act of worship to God, but they leave the final outcome in his hands, and are thus contented and undisturbed with whatever happens.\nHere\u2019s a simple story to illustrate this point. A man had two daughters; the first was married to a farmer and the second was married to a brick kiln owner. One day, the father rang up the first daughter and inquired how she was doing. She replied, \u201cFather, we are going through economic hardships. Please pray to God for us that we may have plentiful rains in the coming months.\u201d He then rang up the second daughter, and she requested, \u201cFather, we are low on funds. Please request God not to send rains this year, so that we may have lots of sunshine and a good production of bricks.\u201d The father heard the opposite requests of his daughters, and thought, \u201cGod alone knows what is best. Let him do what he feels is best.\u201d Such acceptance of the will of God brings detachment from outcomes, despite being immersed in the incessant stream of events in the world."

It is said that good ideas are a dime a dozen, but they are not worth a plug nickel if you don\u2019t act on them. The theoretical Pundits may have knowledge of all the scriptures in their head, but still be bereft of realization. On the other hand, the karm yogis get opportunities day and night to practice the truths of the scriptures. Thus, the consistent performance of karm yog results in the realization of spiritual knowledge. And when one attains the perfection of nai\u1e63hkarmya-siddhi, or actionlessness while performing work, transcendental knowledge becomes available through experience. Fixed in that knowledge, the karm yogi attains the highest perfection of God-realization. Shree Krishna explains how this happens in the next verse few verses."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna concludes his description of the stage of perfection. The words Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 mean the state of Brahman realization. Situated in it, one is prasann\u0101tm\u0101, meaning serene and unaffected by turbid and painful experiences. Na \u015bhochati means one does not grieve nor feel any incompleteness. Na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63hati means one does not crave for any material thing to make one\u2019s happiness complete. Such a yogi sees all living beings with equal vision, realizing the substratum of Brahman in all of them. In such a state, one is situated on the platform of realized knowledge. However, Shree Krishna concludes the verse with a twist. He says that in such a realized state of knowledge, one then attains par\u0101 bhakti (divine love) for God.The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are often fond of saying that bhakti is only to be done as an intermediate step toward Brahman realization. They claim that bhakti is for the purpose of purifying the heart, and at the end of the journey, only j\u00f1\u0101na remains. Thus, they recommend that those who possess a strong intellect can ignore devotion and simply cultivate knowledge. But the above verse negates such a viewpoint. Shree Krishna states that having attained the highest realization of j\u00f1\u0101na, one develops par\u0101 bhakti. Ved Vyas has declared the same in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam:\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101m\u0101\u015bh cha munayo nirgranth\u0101 apy urukramekurvanty ahaituk\u012b\u1e41 bhaktim ittham-bh\u016bta-gu\u1e47o hari\u1e25 (1.7.10)[v24]\u201cEven those who are \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101m (rejoicing in the self), established in self-knowledge, and liberated from material bonds, such perfected souls desire to possess bhakti toward God. The super-excellent qualities of God are such that they attract even the liberated souls.\u201d There are many examples of renowned j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who had attained self-knowledge and were situated in the realization of the formless Brahman. However, when they got a glimpse of the transcendental divine qualities of God, they naturally got drawn toward bhakti. Instances of such j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs from each of the four yugas are given here.The greatest j\u00f1an\u012bs in Satya Yuga were the four sons of Brahma\u2014Sanat Kumar, Sanatan Kumar, Sanak Kumar, and Sanandan Kumar. They were self-realized from birth, and their minds were always absorbed in the formless Brahman. These four brothers once visited Vaikunth, the divine abode of Lord Vishnu. There, the fragrance from the tuls\u012b (holy basil) leaves at the lotus feet of the Lord entered their nostrils, causing a thrill of ecstasy in their hearts. Immediately, their meditation on the attributeless Brahman ended, and they were immersed in the bliss of divine love for Lord Vishnu. They beseeched him for a boon:k\u0101ma\u1e41 bhava\u1e25 sva-v\u1e5bijinair niraye\u1e63hu na\u1e25 st\u0101chcheto \u2019livad yadi nu te padayo rameta\u00a0(Bh\u0101gavatam 3.15.49)[v25]\u201cO Lord, we do not even mind if you send us to hell, so long as our mind gets the opportunity to drink the divine love bliss that emanates from your lotus feet.\u201d Just imagine, even after having realized the formless Brahman, these foremost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs were willing to reside in hell for the sake of relishing the bliss of the personal form of God.Let us now move on to Tret\u0101 Yuga. The topmost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b in this age was King Janak. He was the father of Sita, the eternal consort of Lord Ram. He was also known as Videha, one who was beyond all perceptions of the body. His mind would remain ever absorbed in the formless Brahman. One day, however, Sage Vishwamitra came to meet him, along with Lord Ram and Lakshman. What took place then is described in the Ramayan:inhani bilokata ati anur\u0101g\u0101, barabasa brahmasukhahi mana ty\u0101g\u0101 [v26]\u201cOn seeing Lord Ram, King Janak became detached from the bliss of the formless Brahman, and deeply attached to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.\u201d In this manner, the greatest j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b of the age of Tret\u0101 came to the path of bhakti.\u201dThe topmost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b in the age of Dw\u0101par was Shukadev, the son of Sage Ved Vyas. The Puranas describe him as being so elevated that he remained in his mother\u2019s womb for twelve years, thinking that if he came into the world, the material energy, Maya, would overpower him. Finally, Sage Narad came and spoke to him through his mother\u2019s ear, reassuring him that nothing would happen and he should emerge from the womb. Finally, he emerged, and by his yogic power, he expanded his body to that of a twelve-year old and renounced home to live in the forest. There, he soon reached the highest state of sam\u0101dhi. Years went by, and one day Ved Vyas\u2019s students were cutting wood in the forest, when they saw him in sam\u0101dhi. They went back and told the Sage about it. He told them to recite a verse in Shukadev\u2019s ears, describing the beauty of the personal form of Lord Krishna:barh\u0101p\u012b\u1e0da\u1e41 na\u1e6da-vara-vapu\u1e25 kar\u1e47ayo\u1e25 kar\u1e47ik\u0101ra\u1e41bibhrad v\u0101sa\u1e25 kanaka-kapi\u015bha\u1e41 vaijayant\u012b\u1e41 cha m\u0101l\u0101mrandhr\u0101n ve\u1e47or adhara-sudhay\u0101p\u016brayan gopa-v\u1e5bindairv\u1e5bind\u0101ra\u1e47ya\u1e41 sva-pada-rama\u1e47a\u1e41 pr\u0101vi\u015bhad g\u012bta-k\u012brti\u1e25(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.21.5)[v27]\u201cShree Krishna is adorned with a peacock feathered crown upon his head, and exhibits his form as the greatest dancer. His ears are decorated with blue kar\u1e47ik\u0101 flowers. His shawl is the color of brilliant gold. He wears a garland made of vaijayant\u012b beads. He fills the holes of his flute with the nectar from his lips. His praises are sung as he enters Vrindavan, surrounded by his cowherd friends, and the marks of his footprints beautify the earth.\u201d Shukadev was absorbed in the formless Brahman when the verse entered his ears. Suddenly, the object of his meditation transformed into the enchanting form of Lord Krishna. He felt so deeply attracted to the bliss of the personal form of God, that he left his sam\u0101dhi and went back to his father, Ved Vyas. From him, he heard the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, which is full of the sweetness of bhakti. Later, on the banks of the Ganges, he related it to King Parikshit, grandson of Arjun. In this manner, the greatest j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b of the age of Dw\u0101par got drawn to the path of bhakti.Finally, we come to Kali Yuga. Jagadguru Shankaracharya is widely considered the greatest j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b of this age. He is widely acclaimed as the propagator of advaita v\u0101da (non-dualism), in which he stated that there is only one entity in existence, which is the nirgu\u1e47a (without qualities), nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63ha (attributeless), nir\u0101k\u0101r (formless) Brahman. However, many people are unaware that from the age of twenty until he left his body at the age of thirty-two, he wrote hundreds of verses in praise of Lord Krishna, Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Mother Durga, etc. He also visited the four dh\u0101ms (centers of spirituality in the four corners of India), and worshipped deities of the personal forms of God in all of them. In Prabodh Sudh\u0101kar, he writes:k\u0101myop\u0101sanay\u0101rthayantyanudina\u1e41 ki\u00f1chitphala\u1e41 swepsitamkechit swargamath\u0101pavargamapare yog\u0101diyaj\u00f1\u0101dibhi\u1e25asm\u0101ka\u1e41 yadunandan\u0101\u1e45ghriyugaladhy\u0101n\u0101vadh\u0101n\u0101rthin\u0101mki\u1e41 lokena damena ki\u1e41 n\u1e5bipatin\u0101 swarg\u0101pavargai\u015bhcha kim\u00a0(verse 250)[v28]\u201cThose who perform righteous actions for the attainment of celestial abodes may do so. Those who desire liberation via the path of j\u00f1\u0101na or a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yog may pursue that goal. As for me, I want nothing of these two paths. I wish only to engross myself in the nectar of Shree Krishna\u2019s lotus feet. I do not desire either worldly or heavenly pleasures, nor do I desire liberation. I am a rasik who relishes the bliss of divine love.\u201d The fact is that Shankaracharya was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. What he taught in his bh\u0101\u1e63hyas (commentaries) was the need of the times. When he appeared upon the earth, Buddhism was prevailing all over India. In such an environment, to reestablish the faith of the Buddhists in the Vedas, he sidelined devotion while writing his bh\u0101\u1e63hyas. But later, in the numerous stutis (praises) he wrote for the personal forms of God, he revealed his inner devotion. Shankaracharya was thus an example in the age of Kali, of someone who had reached the highest realization of j\u00f1\u0101na, and who then did devotion."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna stated in the previous verse that on becoming situated in transcendental knowledge one develops devotion. Now he says that only through devotion can one come to know God\u2019s personality. Previously, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b had realized God as the nirgu\u1e47a (quality-less), nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63ha (attribute-less), nir\u0101k\u0101r (formless) Brahman. But the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b had no realization of the personal form of God. The secret of that personal form cannot be known through karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yog, etc. It is love that opens the door to the impossible and makes way for the inaccessible. Shree Krishna states here that the mystery of God\u2019s form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates can only be comprehended through unalloyed devotion. The devotees understand God because they possess the eyes of love.The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 mentions a beautiful incident illustrating the above truth. A \u1e5bi\u1e63hi by the name of Jabali saw a very effulgent and peaceful maiden meditating in the forest. He requested her to reveal her identity and purpose of meditation.

Great yogis and mystics perform austerities to know me. However, I am myself performing severe austerities to develop love at the lotus feet of the personal form of God. I am replete and satiated with the bliss of Brahman. Yet, without loving attachment to Lord Krishna, I feel empty and void.\u201d Thus, mere knowledge is insufficient for relishing the bliss of the personal form of God. It is through bhakti that one enters into this secret and achieves full God-consciousness."

        "commentary": "In the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that through bhakti the devotees enter into full awareness of him. Equipped with it, they see everything in its connection with God. They see their body, mind, and intellect as the energies of God; they see their material possessions as the property of God; they see all living beings as parts and parcels of God; and they see themselves as his tiny servants. In that divine consciousness, they do not give up work, rather they renounce the pride of being the doers and enjoyers of work. They see all work as devotional service to the Supreme, and they depend upon him for its performance.Then, upon leaving their body, they go to the divine abode of God. Just as the material realm is made from the material energy, the divine realm is made from the spiritual energy. Hence, it is free from the defects of material nature, and is perfect in every way. It is sat-chit-\u0101nand i.e., full of eternality, knowledge, and bliss. Regarding his divine realm, Shree Krishna had said in verse 15.6: \u201cNeither the sun nor the moon, nor fire can illumine that Supreme Abode of Mine. Having gone There, one does not return to this material world again.\u201dThe various forms of God have their own personal abodes in the spiritual realm, where they engage in eternal loving pastimes with their devotees. Those who perfect their selfless loving service toward him go to the abode of their worshipped form of God. Thus, the devotees of Lord Krishna go to Golok; those of Lord Vishnu go to Vaikunth; the devotees of Lord Ram go to Saket; the worshippers of Lord Shiv go to Shiv Lok; those of Mother Durga go to Devi Lok, etc. The devotees, who reach these divine abodes, having attained him, participate in his divine pastimes that are imbued with the perfection of the spiritual energy."

        "commentary": "Yog means \u201cunion,\u201d and buddhi yog means \u201chaving the intellect united with God.\u201d This union of the intellect occurs when it is firmly convinced that everything in existence has emanated from God, is connected to him, and is meant for his satisfaction. Let us understand the position of the intellect in our internal system.Within our body is the subtle anta\u1e25 kara\u1e47, which we also refer to colloquially as the heart, or the etheric heart. It has four aspects to it. When it creates thoughts, we call it mana, or mind. When it analyses and decides, we call it buddhi, or intellect. When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it chitta. When it identifies with the attributes of the body and becomes proud, we call it ahank\u0101r, or ego.In this internal machinery, the position of the intellect is dominant. It makes decision, while the mind desires in accordance with those decisions, and the chitta gets attached to the objects of affection. For example, if the intellect decides that security is the most important thing in the world, then the mind always yearns for security in life. Throughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect. That is why anger flows downward. The CEO shouts at the director. The director does not shout back, because the intellect realizes that it will cost him the job; he vents his anger at the manager. The manager controls himself, despite feeling vexed with the director; but finds release by shouting at the foreman. The foreman takes it all out at the worker. The worker purges his frustration on the wife. The wife shouts at the children. In each case, the intellect decides where it is dangerous to get angry, and where it does not have repercussions. The example illustrates that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind.Thus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction. This is what Shree Krishna means by buddhi yog\u2014developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work and all things are meant for the pleasure of God. For such a person of resolute intellect, the chitta easily gets attached to God."

The soul does not lead an independent existence; it is dependent upon God\u2019s creation in many ways. In the materially bound state, it is under the influence of the three gu\u1e47as. The combination of gu\u1e47as creates our nature, and according to its dictates, we are compelled to act. Hence, we do not have absolute freedom to say, \u201cI will do what I like.\u201d We have to choose between the good advice of God and the scriptures or the compulsions of our nature. There is an anecdote regarding one\u2019s nature. A soldier retired after thirty years of service and returned to his hometown. One day, he was standing in the coffee shop drinking a cup of tea, when a friend thought of a practical joke. He screamed from behind, \u201cAttention!\u201d Responding to that command had become a part of the soldier\u2019s nature. Involuntarily, he dropped the cup from his hand and put his hands by his side. Shree Krishna warns Arjun that by nature he is a warrior, and if, out of pride, he decides not to listen to good advice, his Kshatriya nature will still compel him to fight."

Your inborn qualities of heroism, chivalry, and patriotism will compel you to fight. You have been trained in past lifetimes and in this one, to honor your duty as a warrior. Is it possible for you to be inactive when you see injustice being meted out to others in front of your eyes? Your nature and inclinations are such that you vehemently oppose evil wherever you see it. Therefore, it is beneficial for you to fight in accordance with my instructions, rather than be compelled by your nature to do the same.\u201d"

The body in which you reside is a machine made from my material energy. Based upon your past karmas, I have given you the kind of body you deserved. I too am seated in it, and am noting all your thoughts, words, and deeds. So, I will also judge whatever you do in the present, to decide your future. Do not think you are independent of me in any condition. Hence Arjun, it is in your self-interest to surrender to me.\u201d"

        "commentary": "Being dependent upon God, the soul must also depend upon his grace to get out of its present predicament and attain the ultimate goal. Self-effort will never suffice for this. But if God bestows his grace, he will grant his divine knowledge and divine bliss upon the soul, and release it from the bondage of the material energy. Shree Krishna emphasizes that by his grace, one will attain eternal beatitude and the imperishable abode. However, to receive that grace, the soul must qualify itself by surrendering to God. Even a worldly father will not hand over all his precious possessions to his child until the child becomes responsible enough to utilize them properly. Similarly, the grace of God is not a whimsical act; he has perfectly rational rules on the basis of which he bestows it.If God does not follow rules while bestowing grace, people\u2019s faith in him will break. Let us say, for example, that there is a father who has two sons. He instructs both of them to work hard in the paddy field as it is the cultivation season. One son toils and sweats it out in the blazing son all day long. In the night when he returns, the father says, \u201cWell done my son. You are obedient, hard-working, and loyal. Here is your reward. Take $500 and do what you like with it.\u201d The second son does nothing\u2014he lies in bed all day long, sleeping, drinking, smoking, and abusing his father. At night, suppose the father says, \u201cNever mind, after all you are also my son. Here is $500; go and enjoy yourself with it.\u201d The result of this will be that the first son\u2019s motivation to work hard will be smothered. He will say, \u201cIf this is my father\u2019s reward system, then why should I work? I will also do nothing, for I will receive the $500 in any case.\u201d Likewise, if God grants his grace without our becoming qualified for it, all those who became saints in the past will complain, \u201cWhat is this? We strived for many lifetimes to purify ourselves and then we became recipients of God\u2019s grace, but this person received it without making himself eligible. Then our effort for self-improvement was meaningless.\u201d God says, \u201cI do not behave in this irrational manner. I have an eternal condition on the basis of which I bestow my grace. And I have declared this in all the scriptures.\u201d The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had states:yo brahm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 vidadh\u0101ti p\u016brva\u1e41 yo vai ved\u0101n\u015bh cha prahi\u1e47oti tasmaita\u1e41 ha deva\u1e41 \u0101tma-buddhi-prak\u0101\u015bha\u1e41 mumuk\u1e63hur vai \u015bhara\u1e47am aha\u1e41 prapadye (6.18)[v30]\u201cWe take shelter of that Supreme Being who created Brahma and others. It is by his grace that the soul and intellect get illumined.\u201d The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:m\u0101m ekam eva \u015bhara\u1e47am \u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 sarva-dehin\u0101my\u0101hi sarv\u0101tma-bh\u0101vena may\u0101 sy\u0101 hy akuto-bhaya\u1e25 (11.12.15)[v31]\u201cO Uddhav! Giving up all forms of mundane social and religious conventions, simply surrender unto me, the Supreme Soul of all souls. Only then can you cross over this material ocean and become fearless.\u201dShree Krishna also stated it in verse 7.14 of the Bhagavad Gita: \u201cMy divine energy Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome. But those who surrender unto me cross over it easily.\u201dThe Ramayan also says:sanamukha hoi j\u012bva mohi jabah\u012b\u1e45, janma ko\u1e6di agha n\u0101sahi\u1e45 tabah\u012b\u1e45 [v32]\u201cThe moment the soul surrenders to God, its account of sinful deeds in endless past lifetimes is destroyed by his grace.\u201dIn the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has reiterated the principle of the necessity for surrendering to God to receive his grace. The details of what it means to surrender are explained in the Hari Bhakti Vilas, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, the Vayu Puran, and the Ahirbudhni Samhita in the following manner:\u0101nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kalpa\u1e25 pratik\u016blyasya varjanamrak\u1e63hi\u1e63hyat\u012bti vi\u015bhv\u0101so gopt\u1e5bitve vara\u1e47a\u1e41 tath\u0101\u0101tmanik\u1e63hepa k\u0101rpa\u1e47ye \u1e63ha\u1e0dvidh\u0101 \u015bhara\u1e47\u0101gati\u1e25(Hari Bhakti Vilas 11.676)[v33]The above verse explains the six aspects of surrender to God:1. To desire only in accordance with the desire of God.  By nature, we are his servants, and the duty of a servant is to fulfill the desire of the master. So as surrendered devotees of God, we must make our will conform to the divine will of God. A dry leaf is surrendered to the wind. It does not complain whether the wind lifts it up, takes it forward or backward, or drops it to the ground. Similarly, we too must learn to be happy in the happiness of God.2. Not to desire against the desire of God.  Whatever we get in life is a result of our past and present karmas. However, the fruits of the karmas do not come by themselves. God notes them and gives the results at the appropriate time. Since God himself dispenses the results, we must learn to serenely accept them. Usually, when people get wealth, fame, pleasure, and luxuries in the world, they forget to thank God. However, if they get suffering, they blame God for it, \u201cWhy did God do this to me?\u201d The second aspect of surrender means to not complain about whatever God gives us.3. To have firm faith that God is protecting us. God is the eternal father. He is taking care of all the living beings in creation. There are trillions of ants on the planet earth, and all of them need to eat regularly. Do you ever find that a few thousand ants in your garden have died of starvation? God ensures that they are all provided for. On the other hand, elephants eat mounds of food every day. God provides for them too. Even a worldly father cares and provides for his children. Why then should we doubt whether our eternal father, God, will take care of us or not? To have firm faith in his protection is the third aspect of surrender.4. To maintain an attitude of gratitude toward God. We have received so many priceless gifts from the Lord. The earth that we walk upon, the sunlight with which we see, the air that we breathe, and the water that we drink, are all given to us by God. In fact, it is because of him that we exist; he has brought us to life and imparted consciousness in our soul. We are not paying him any tax in return, but we must at least feel deeply indebted for all that he has given to us. This is the sentiment of gratitude.The reverse of this is the sentiment of ungratefulness. For example, a father does so much for his child. The child is told to be grateful to his father for this. But the child responds, \u201cWhy should I be grateful? His father took care of him and he is taking care of me.\u201d This is ingratitude toward the worldly father. To be grateful toward God, our eternal Father, for all that he has given to us, is the fourth aspect of surrender.5. To see everything we possess as belonging to God.  God created this entire world; it existed even before we were born, and will continue to exist even after we die. Hence, the true owner of everything is God alone. When we think something belongs to us, we forget the proprietorship of God. Let us say that someone comes into your house when you are not at home. He wears your clothes, takes things out of your refrigerator, eats them, and sleeps on your bed. On returning, you ask indignantly, \u201cWhat have you been doing in my house?\u201d He says, \u201cI have not damaged anything. I have merely used everything properly. Why are you getting annoyed?\u201d You will reply, \u201cYou may not have destroyed anything, but it all belongs to me. If you use it without my permission, you are a thief.\u201d Similarly, this world and everything in it belongs to God. To remember this and give up our sense of proprietorship is the fifth aspect of surrender.6. To give up the pride of having surrendered.  If we become proud of the good deeds that we have done, the pride dirties our heart and undoes the good we have done. That is why it is important to keep an attitude of humbleness: \u201cIf I was able to do something nice, it was only because God inspired my intellect in the right direction. Left to myself, I would never have been able to do it.\u201d To keep such an attitude of humility is the sixth aspect of surrender.If we can perfect these six points of surrender in ourselves, we will fulfill God\u2019s condition and he will bestow his Grace upon us."

        "commentary": "A secret is that knowledge which is not accessible to majority of the people. Most of the laws of Physics were a secret until a few centuries ago, and many still continue to remain so. Spiritual knowledge is profound and not realizable through direct perception. It needs to be learnt through the Guru and the scriptures. Hence, it is described as secret. In the second chapter, Shree Krishna had revealed knowledge of the soul, which is guhya, or secret knowledge. In the seventh and eighth chapters, he explained knowledge of his powers, which is guhyatar, or more secret. In the ninth and subsequent chapters, he revealed knowledge of his bhakti, which is guhyatamam, or most secret. In the present chapter, verse 55, he revealed that he can be known in his personal form only by bhakti. Shree Krishna is now concluding the Bhagavad Gita. Having spoken the eighteen chapters, including most secret knowledge to Arjun, he now leaves the choice in Arjun\u2019s hands. He says, \u201cI have revealed to you profound and confidential knowledge. Now the choice is in your hands.\u201d Lord Ram made a similar statement to the residents of Ayodhya. He invited them all for his discourse:eka b\u0101ra raghun\u0101tha bol\u0101e, guru dwija purab\u0101s\u012b saba \u0101e (Ramayan) [v34]\u201cOnce, Lord Ram called all the residents of Ayodhya. Everyone, including Guru Vasishth came to hear him.\u201d In the discourse, Lord Ram explained to them the purpose of human life and the way to accomplish it. In the end, he concluded:nahi\u1e45 an\u012bti nahi\u1e45 kachhu prabhut\u0101\u012b, sunahu karahu jo tumhahi soh\u0101\u012b (Ramayan) [v35]\u201cThe advice I have given to you is neither incorrect nor coercive. Listen to it carefully, contemplate over it, and then do what you wish.\u201dThis free will to choose between available alternatives has been given to the soul by God. The freedom of choice is not infinite. One cannot decide, \u201cI choose to be the most intelligent person in the world.\u201d Our choices are limited by our past and present karmas. However, we do possess a certain amount of free will, for we are not machines in the hands of God. Sometimes people question that if God had not given us free will then we would not have done any evil. But then we would not have done anything good either. The opportunity to do good always comes with the danger of doing evil. More importantly, God wants us to love him, and love is only possible when there is a choice. A machine cannot love for it does not have any freedom of choice. God created us with free will and provided us with choices so that we may choose him and thereby exercise our love for him. Even the all-powerful God cannot force the soul to love and surrender to him; this decision has to be made by the soul itself. Here, Shree Krishna is calling Arjun\u2019s attention to his free will and asking him to choose."

Before sharing it, he considers many things, such as the preparedness of the student to receive it, comprehend it, benefit from it, etc. In the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun was bewildered by the problems facing him and asked for guidance from Shree Krishna. The Lord enlightened him with great care and consideration, uplifting his understanding a little by little, through the eighteen chapters. Having seen Arjun receive the message so well, Shree Krishna now feels confident that he will be able to grasp the final and most profound knowledge as well. Further, he says i\u1e63h\u1e6do \u2018si me d\u1e5bi\u1e0dhamiti, meaning, \u201cI am speaking this to you because you are my very dear friend.

The perfect example of someone completely absorbed in devotion was King Ambarish.

He utilized his feet for walking to the holy abodes, and his head in offering obeisance to the lotus feet of God. He offered all paraphernalia, such as garlands and sandalwood, in the service of God. He did all this, not with some selfish motive, but only to attain the selfless service of Lord Krishna, through purification.\u201dThe instruction to wholeheartedly engage in devotion is the essence of all the scriptures, and the summum bonum of all knowledge. However, this is not the most confidential knowledge that Shree Krishna referred to, for he has already mentioned this earlier. He now reveals this supreme secret in this next verse."

        "commentary": "All along, Shree Krishna had been asking Arjun to do two things simultaneously\u2014engage his mind in devotion, and engage his body in fulfilling his material duty as a warrior. He thus wanted Arjun not to give up his Kshatriya dharma, but to do devotion alongside with it. This is the principle of karm yog. Now, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that here is no need to fulfill even material dharma. Arjun can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God. This is the principle of karm sany\u0101s. Here, one may question that if we give up all our material dharmas will we not incur sin? Shree Krishna tells Arjun not to fear; he will absolve him from all sins, and liberate him from material existence.To comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the term dharma. It comes from the root word dh\u1e5bi, which means dh\u0101ra\u1e47 karane yogya, or \u201cresponsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.\u201d There are actually two kinds of dharmas\u2014material dharma and spiritual dharma. These two kinds of dharma are based upon two different understandings of the \u201cself.\u201d When we identify ourselves as the body, then our dharma is determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms. Hence, serving the bodily parents, fulfilling the responsibilities to society, nation, etc. are all bodily dharma. This is also called apara dharma or material dharma. This includes the dharma as a Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc. However, when we identify ourselves as the soul, we have no material designations of var\u1e47a (social class) and \u0101\u015bhram (status in life). The soul\u2019s Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved, and resting place are all God. Hence our one and only dharma becomes loving devotional service to God. This is also called para dharma or spiritual dharma.If one leaves the material dharma it is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty. But if one leaves material dharma and takes the shelter of spiritual dharma, it is not a sin. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:devar\u1e63hi-bh\u016bt\u0101pta-n\u1e5bi\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 pit\u1e5d\u012b\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 na ki\u1e45karo n\u0101yam \u1e5bi\u1e47\u012b cha r\u0101jansarv\u0101tman\u0101 ya\u1e25 \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 \u015bhara\u1e47ya\u1e41 gato mukunda\u1e41 parih\u1e5bitya kartam (11.5.41)[v37]This verse explains that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts\u2014to the celestial gods, to the sages, to the ancestors, to other humans, and to other living beings. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts. However, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts, just as by watering the roots of a tree, all its branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruit automatically get watered. Similarly, by fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone. Hence, there is no sin in renouncing material dharma if we are properly situated in spiritual dharma. In fact, the ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual dharma. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:\u0101j\u00f1\u0101yaiva\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n do\u1e63h\u0101n may\u0101di\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101n api svak\u0101ndharm\u0101n santyajya ya\u1e25 sarv\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 bhajeta sa tu sattama\u1e25 (11.11.32) [v38]\u201cI have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodily dharma in the Vedas. But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties, to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best s\u0101dhaks.\u201d In the Ramayan, we read how Lakshman renounced all material duties to accompany Lord Ram in the forest. He said:guru pitu m\u0101tu na j\u0101nahu k\u0101h\u016b, kahahu subh\u0101\u016b n\u0101tha patiy\u0101\u016bmore sabahi\u00f1 eka tumha sw\u0101m\u012b, dinabhandhu ura antarayam\u012b [v39]\u201cO Lord, please believe me, I do not know any teacher, father, mother, etc. As far as I am concerned, you, the savior of the fallen and the knower of the heart, are my Master and my everything.\u201d Similarly, Prahlad said:m\u0101t\u0101 n\u0101sti pit\u0101 na \u2019sti na \u2019sti me swajano jana\u1e25 [v40]\u201cI do not know any mother, father, or relative (God is everything to me).\u201dIn the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions. Initially, he instructed Arjun to do karm, i.e. his material dharma as a warrior (verse 2.31). But material dharma does not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back. Hence, Shree Krishna next instructed Arjun to do karm yog, i.e. his material dharma with the body and spiritual dharma with the mind. He asked Arjun to fight the war with the body and remember God with the mind (verse 8.7). This instruction of karm yog forms the major portion of the Bhagavad Gita. Now in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practice karm sany\u0101s, i.e. renounce all material dharma and simply adopt spiritual dharma, which is love for God. He should thus fight, not because it is his duty as a warrior, but because God wants him to do so.But why did Shree Krishna not give this instruction to Arjun earlier? Why did he seem to clearly extol just the reverse in verse 5.2 when he stated karm yog superior as to karm sany\u0101s? Lord Krishna clearly explains this in the next verse."

        "commentary": "It was explained in the previous verse that if one is situated in loving devotion to God, there is no sin in giving up the material duties. However, there is one problem with this instruction. If we have not yet become established in love for God, and we prematurely give up material duties, we will be neither here nor there. Thus, karm sany\u0101s is only for those who are qualified for it. And what we are qualified for has to be determined by our Guru, who knows our capabilities and the stringency of the paths. If a student wishes to become a graduate, it will not do to directly go and attend the graduation ceremony. We will have to begin studies sequentially from grade one. Similarly, the vast majority of people are eligible for karm yog, and it would be a great folly for them to prematurely take karm sany\u0101s. It is better to instruct them to fulfill their bodily dharma and practice devotion alongside. That is why, in this verse Shree Krishna says that this confidential teaching given by him is not for everyone. Before sharing it with others, we should check their eligibility for this teaching.This word of caution applies specifically for the confidential teachings of the previous verse, and in general, for the entire message of the Bhagavad Gita. If it is explained to someone who is envious of Shree Krishna, that person may respond, \u201cShree Krishna was very conceited. He kept asking Arjun to glorify him.\u201d By misunderstanding the teachings, the faithless listener will be harmed by the divine message. The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 also states:a\u015bhraddadh\u0101ne vimukhe \u2019py a\u015bh\u1e5bi\u1e47vati ya\u015bh chopade\u015bha\u1e25 \u015bhiva-n\u0101m\u0101par\u0101dha\u1e25 [v41]\u201cBy giving transcendental instructions to those who are faithless and averse to God, we cause them to become offenders.\u201d Hence, Shree Krishna describes the disqualifications for listeners in the above verse."

He says such preachers first attain his para bhakti, and then attain him.The opportunity to engage ourselves in devotion is a special blessing of God, but the opportunity to help others engage in devotion is an even bigger blessing, which attracts the special grace of God. Whenever we share something good with others, we benefit from it too. When we share whatever knowledge we have with others, by grace our own knowledge increases as well. By often giving food to others, we never go hungry ourselves.

        "commentary": "Amongst all the gifts we can give to others, the gift of spiritual knowledge is one of the highest, because it has the capacity to transform the recipient eternally. King Janak had asked his Guru, \u201cThe transcendental knowledge you have bestowed upon me is so precious that I feel deeply indebted to you. What can I give you in return?\u201d Guru Ashtavakra replied, \u201cThere is nothing you can give that will relinquish you from your debt. The knowledge I gave was divine and all that you possess is material. Worldly objects can never be a price for divine knowledge. But you can do one thing. If ever you find someone who is thirsty for this knowledge, share it with him.\u201d Shree Krishna states here that he considers the sharing of the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita as the highest loving service one can render to God. However, those who lecture on the Bhagavad Gita should not feel they are doing something very great. The proper attitude of the teacher is to see oneself as an instrument in the hands of God, and to accord all credit to the grace of the Lord."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna had repeatedly told Arjun to surrender his intellect to him (verses 8.7, 12.8). This does not imply that we stop using the intellect; rather it means we utilize our intellect to the best of our ability in fulfilling his will for us. From the message of the Bhagavad Gita we understand what his will is. Hence, those who study this sacred dialogue worship God with their intellect."

        "commentary": "Not everyone has the intellect to comprehend the deep imports of the dialogue between Shree Krishna and Arjun. Here, Shree Krishna reassures that if such people merely hear with faith, they will also benefit. God is seated within them; he will note their sincere endeavor and reward them for it. A story about a disciple of Jagadguru Shankaracharya, called Sananda, illustrates this point. He was illiterate and could not comprehend his Guru\u2019s teaching as the other disciples could. But when Shankaracharya delivered the discourse, he would listen with rapt attention and great faith. One day, he was washing his Guru\u2019s clothes on the other side of the river. It became time for the class, and the other disciples requested, \u201cGuruji, please begin the class.\u201d Shankaracharya replied, \u201cLet us wait; Sananda is not here.\u201d \u201cBut Guruji, he cannot understand anything,\u201d the disciples urged. \u201cThat is true; still, he listens with great faith and so I do not wish to disappoint him,\u201d said Shankaracharya.Then, to show the power of faith, Shankaracharya called out, \u201cSananda! Please come here.\u201d On hearing his Guru\u2019s words, Sananda did not hesitate. He ran on water. The story goes that wherever he placed his feet, lotus flowers sprang up to support him. He crossed over to the other bank and offered obeisance to his Guru. At that time, a stuti (verses in praise) of the Guru emanated from his mouth in sophisticated Sanskrit. The other disciples were amazed to hear this. Since, lotus flowers had bloomed under his feet, his name became \u201cPadmapada,\u201d meaning \u201cthe one with lotus flowers under the feet.\u201d He became one of the four main disciples of Shankaracharya, along with Sureshwaracharya, Hastamalak, and Trotakacharya. In the above verse, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that even those who merely hear the sacred dialogue with great faith will gradually become purified."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna has taken the position of being Arjun\u2019s teacher. It is natural for the teacher to inquire whether the student has grasped the subject or not. Shree Krishna\u2019s intention of asking the question is that if Arjun has not understood, he is ready to re-explain or go into further details."

        "commentary": "At the outset, Arjun was faced with a bewildering situation, and confused about his duty in the situation. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he had sat down on his chariot, and\u00a0gave\u00a0up his weapons. He had confessed that he could find no remedy to the grief that attacked his body and senses. But he now finds himself completely transformed, and announces that he is situated in knowledge and no longer perplexed. He has given himself to the will of God and shall do what Shree Krishna instructed him to do. This was the impact of the message of Bhagavad Gita upon him. However, he adds tvat pras\u0101d\u0101n may\u0101chyuta, meaning, \u201cO Shree Krishna, it was not just your lecture, but your grace that dispelled my ignorance.\u201dMaterial knowledge does not require grace. We can pay the educational institute or teacher and receive knowledge in return, but spiritual knowledge can neither be purchased nor sold. It is offered through grace and received through faith and humbleness. Thus, if we approach the Bhagavad Gita with an attitude of pride, \u201cI am so intelligent. I will evaluate what the net worth of this message is,\u201d we will never be able to comprehend it. Our intellect will find some apparent defect in the scripture to dwell upon, and on that pretext we will reject the entire scripture as incorrect. There have been so many commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and innumerable readers of the divine message in the last 5,000 years, but how many people have become enlightened like Arjun? If we wish to truly receive this knowledge, we must not merely read it, but also attract Shree Krishna\u2019s grace with an attitude of faith and loving surrender. Then we will know the purport of the Bhagavad Gita by his grace."

        "commentary": "In this way, Sanjay comes to the end of his narration of the divine discourse of the Bhagavad Gita. He refers to Arjun as mah\u0101tm\u0101 (great soul), as he has heeded the advice and instructions of Shree Krishna, and hence has become eminently wise. Sanjay now remarks how amazed and astounded he is on hearing their divine dialogue. The hair standing on end is one of the symptoms of deep devotional fervor. The Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu states:stambha sveda \u2019tha rom\u0101\u00f1cha\u1e25 svara bhedo\u2019tha vepathu\u1e25vaivar\u1e47yama\u015bhru pralaya itya\u1e63h\u1e6dau s\u0101ttvik\u0101\u1e25 sm\u1e5bit\u0101\u1e25 [v43]\u201cThe eight symptoms of devotional ecstasy are: becoming stupefied and motionless, sweating, hair standing on end, choking of the voice, trembling, color of the face becoming ashen, shedding tears, and fainting.\u201d Sanjay is experiencing such intense devotional sentiments that his hair is bristling with divine joy.One may ask how was it possible for Sanjay to hear this dialogue that took place on a far-off battlefield. He reveals this in the next verse."

        "commentary": "Shree Krishna Dwaipayan Vyasadev, also known as Sage Ved Vyas, was the spiritual master of Sanjay. By the grace of his Guru, Sanjay had been blessed with the power of clairvoyance, to know all that transpired on the battleground of Kurukshetra while he sat in the royal palace of Hastinapur. Here, Sanjay acknowledges it was by his Guru\u2019s mercy that he got the opportunity to hear the supreme science of Yog from the Lord of Yog himself, Shree Krishna.Ved Vyas, the author of the Brahma S\u016btras, the Pura\u1e47as, the Mahabharat, etc. was a descension of God, and possessed all the clairvoyant powers himself. Thus, he not only heard the conversation between Shree Krishna and Arjun, but also the one between Sanjay and Dhritarasthra. Thereby, he included both conversations while compiling the Bhagavad Gita."

Sanjay is rejoicing in such happiness and sharing his experience with the blind Dhritarashtra. Reflecting and remembering wonderful dialogue, he is feeling divine bliss. This indicates the sublimity of the knowledge contained in this scripture and the divinity of the leela (pastimes) that Sanjay was a witness to."

        "commentary": "Arjun was blessed with the vision of the cosmic form of the Lord, which is rarely seen even by the greatest yogis. Shree Krishna told him that he was showing him the universal form because Arjun was his devotee and friend, and thus very dear to him. Sanjay also came to see that cosmic form because he was fortunate to be a part of the divine pastimes as the narrator. There are times when an unexpected grace comes our way. If we utilize it properly, we can progress rapidly in our s\u0101dhan\u0101. Sanjay is repeatedly contemplating upon what he saw and flowing in the current of devotion."

        "commentary": "The Bhagavad Gita concludes with this verse delivering a deep pronouncement. Dhritarashtra was apprehensive of the outcome of the war. Sanjay informs him that material calculations of the relative strengths and numbers of the two armies are irrelevant. There can be only one verdict in this war\u2014victory will always be on the side of God and his pure devotee, and so will goodness, supremacy, and abundance.\nGod is the independent, self-sustaining sovereign of the world, and the most worthy object of adoration, and worship. na tatsama\u015bh ch\u0101bhyadhika\u015bhcha d\u1e5bi\u015bhyate (\u015ahweta\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had 6.8) [v44] \u201cThere is no one equal to him; there is no one greater than him.\u201d He merely needs a proper medium to manifest his incomparable glory. The soul who surrenders to him provides such a vehicle for the glory of God to shine forth. Thus, wherever the Supreme Lord and his pure devotee are present, the light of the Absolute Truth will always vanquish the darkness of falsehood. There can be no other outcome."
