The Gītā Dhyānam, also called the Gītā Dhyāna or the Dhyāna Ślokas associated with the Gītā, is a 9-verse Sanskrit poem that has often been attached to the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most important scriptures of Hinduism. In English, its title can be translated literally as ‘meditation on the Gita’ and it is also sometimes called the Invocation to the Gita.

The nine Gita Dhyanam verses offer salutations to a variety of sacred scriptures, Gods, and other entities, characterize the relationship of the Gita to the Upanishads, and affirm the power of divine assistance.

Gita Dhyanam is like a prayer. The purpose of studying the prayer verses is to invoke the grace of the Lord so that we can successfully complete the study of the Bhagavad Gita. To ward off the obstacles that may come. You know Bhagavad Gita is part of Mahabharata but these prayer verses are not from Mahabharata. The prayer verses were written by a great acharya by name Madhusudana Saraswati before he wrote his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita. The name of his commentary is called Gudhartha Dipika, a lamp which illumines the hidden and deeper meanings of the Bhagavad Gita. It is a very famous commentary on the Gita. Before starting the actual Gita we study of the nine verses of Dhyana Sloka written by this Acharya.

In these verses, the Acharya offers Namaskarams to Mahabharatam (for it is the greatest book), Bhagavad Gita (looking upon Gita as mother Saraswati, the embodiment of wisdom), Vyasacharya (the author of Mahabharatam and therefore the author of Gita also), and Krishna (who gives the Gita teaching to Arjuna).
